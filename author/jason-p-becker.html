      <blockquote>
<p>“We are trying to work towards late-exit <span class="caps">ELL</span> programs so (students) can learn the concepts in (their) native language,” Lusi said. Administrative goals have recently shifted to a focus on proficiency in both languages because bilingual education is preferred, she&nbsp;added.</p>
<p>But instituting district-wide bilingual education would require funding to hire teachers certified in both languages and to buy dual-language materials, she&nbsp;said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am pretty sure this is new. I am surprised there has not been a stronger effort to pass a legislative package in Rhode Island that provides both the policy framework and funding necessary to achieve universal bilinguage education for English language learners in <span class="caps">RI</span>&nbsp;schools.</p>
<p>One of the great advantages of transitioning to common standards<sup id="fnref:CCSS"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:CCSS" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is there should be greater availability of curricular materials in languages other than English. I suspect most of what is needed for bilingual education is start up money for materials, curriculum supports and developments, and assessment materials. There are a few policy things that need to be in place, possibly around state exams, but also rules around flexible teacher assignment, hiring, and dismissal staffing needs dramatically&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>Someone should be putting this package together. I suspect there would be broad&nbsp;support.</p>
