        <h1 class="title">NaNo(Blo)WriMo<a href="./2014/11/nanoblowrimo.html" class=perma>&#8734;</a></h1>
        <p class=date> 2014-11-02 </p>

      <p>November marks the start of National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo). The quick version is folks band together and support each other to write 50,000 words in&nbsp;November.</p>
<p>I would love to write a novel one day. I am not sure I could do it well, but I am pretty sure I could hit 50,000-80,000 words if I dedicated time to tell a&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a story to&nbsp;tell.</p>
<p>So this year, I have decided to not feel guilty about skipping out on another NaNoWriMo (<em>always the reader, never the author</em>), and instead I am modifying it to meet my needs. With no story to tell and no experience tackling a single project the size of a novel, I am going to tackle a smaller problem&#8212; this&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p>Instead of 50,000 words in 30 days, I am going to try and write 1000 words a day for the next four weeks. I will not hold myself to a topic. I will not even hold myself to non-fiction. I will not hold myself to a number of posts or the size of the posts I write. I will not even hold myself to true daily count, instead reviewing where I stand at the end of each&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>I am hoping that the practice of simply writing will grease my knuckles and start the avalanche that leads to writing more. A small confession&#8212; I write two or three blog posts every week that never leave my drafts. I find myself unable to hit publish because the ideas tend to be far larger or far smaller than I anticipate when I set out to write and share my frustrations. I also get nervous, particularly when writing about things I do professionally, about not writing the perfect post that&#8217;s clear, heavily researched, and expresses my views definitively and completely. This month, I say goodbye to that anxiety and start simply hitting&nbsp;publish.</p>
<p>I will leave you with several&nbsp;warnings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Things might get topically wacky. I might suddenly become a food blogger, or write about more personal issues, or write a short story and suddenly whiplash to talking about programming, education policy, or the upcoming election. If high volume, random topics aren&#8217;t your thing, you should probably unsubscribe from my <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed and check back in a&nbsp;month.</li>
<li>I might write terrible arguments that are poorly supported and ultimately don&#8217;t reflect my views. This month, I will not accept my most common excuses for not publishing, which boil down to fear I will be held to the views I write and my first-draft thinking. I am going to make mistakes this month in public and print the dialog I am having with myself. You may be shocked and offended by voices I allow room to speak as I struggled with values, beliefs, and opinions. This month, this blog is my internal dialog. Please read it as a struggle, however definitive the&nbsp;tone.</li>
<li>I am often disappointed that the only things I publish are smaller ideas written hastily with poor editing. Again, this month I embrace the reality that almost everything I ended up publishing is written in 20 minutes of furious typing with no looking back, rather than trying to be a strong writer with a strong view point and strong&nbsp;support.</li>
</ol>
