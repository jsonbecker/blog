<p>I am a firm believer that some goods <em>should be</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_goods">public</a>. I do not believe that my tax dollars are about providing <em>direct</em> personal benefit. I like redistributed tax policy. But it is hard to be a Rhode Islander, surrounded by government institutions <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/news/julia-steiny-woonsockets-nosedive-a-cautionary-tale/">that</a> are
<a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/news/procap/">failing</a>, and feel good about the taxes I pay. Corruption and <a href="http://www2.turnto10.com/news/2012/apr/06/former-uri-president-enters-sport-institute-scanda-ar-991425/">cronyism</a> is a daily reality of government business. Some agencies have <a href="http://www.ripec.org/pdfs/2009-AI-Study.pdf">tremendous waste and inefficiency</a>. Worse, many public institutions that are failing their mission and wasting money are actually woefully underfunded. <sup id="fnref:underfunded"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:underfunded" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>If more government institutions functioned like the Downtown Improvement District, there would be greater trust and support for government services.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the best money I spend each year is the approximately \$200-250 that I send to the <a href="http://downtownprovidence.com/clean-safe/">Downtown Improvement District</a> (DID).</p>
<p>I live within a special assessment district in Providence that levies an additional property tax to pay for the ladies and gentlemen in bright yellow jackets that are a constant presence in my neighborhood. For a small tax each year, my neighborhood gets:</p>
<ul>
<li>substantial cleanup /sanitation services that removes the mountains of trash that can pile up during a busy night where <a href="http://jwu.edu/providence/">college students</a>, <a href="http://www.ppacri.org/">theater</a> <a href="http://www.trinityrep.com/">goers</a>, <a href="http://graciesprovidence.com/">restaurant patrons</a>, nightclub patrons, <a href="http://www.hotelprovidence.com/">tourists</a>, and <a href="http://www.waterfire.org/">Waterfire</a> visitors all converge on Downcity </li>
<li>excellent landscaping including planting and pruning trees, maintaining flowerbeds, hanging flower pots on light posts, etc. </li>
<li>responsive care of public property including removing safety hazards, e.g. removing the cement, waist-high barrier that had fallen on the sidewalk by my building that was a major safety hazard for pedestrians </li>
<li>easily identifiable public presence in addition to cops that increases the safety and security of busy city street </li>
<li>much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may seem selfish, but honestly, this is the best government service I current receive. It is inexpensive. I am able to see a direct increase in my quality of life in Downcity. It clearly increases and protects my property investment. I get an annual budget that is fairly detailed
mailed annually that explains precisely what my dollars purchased and how they will be used in the coming years.</p>
<p>When the currently dormant<a href="http://providencecoreconnector.com/">^0</a>[] announced they would seek to use a special assessment district to fund operation expenses, <a href="http://blog.jasonpbecker.com/2011/09/26/downcity-residents-should-support-the-core-connector-and-the-tax-makes-sense/">I was all for it</a>. Sure, a
portion of my support came from the simple economics, but I would be lying if I did not admit that the wonderful relationship I have with the Downtown Improvement District was not a part of my consideration. The DID has provided an excellent model to Downcity residents demonstratingthe efficacy of using the greatest (but not sole) beneficiary of place-bound services as a revenue source. Does anyone really believe that Downtown would have doubled its residency from 2000-2010 <sup id="fnref:census"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:census" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> if the DID were not around?</p>
