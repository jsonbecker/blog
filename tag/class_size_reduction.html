      <p class=date> 2012-01-07 </p>
      <p>I read an interesting <a href="http://goo.gl/SSY83">article</a> this morning on Israeli
schools. Facing extreme poverty among Arab-Israeli&#8217;s and the
ultra-orthodox, Israel struggles to maintain three separate school
systems and succeed. It reminded me of some interesting centralized
policy reforms in Israel that have led to great natural experiments. For
example, so-called Maimonides Laws which capped class sizes at 40,
allowed for some really interesting regression-discontinuity studies on
the impact of class size <sup id="fnref:classsize"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:classsize" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>What I found most interesting in this article, however, was the point
made by Jon&nbsp;Medved:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While agreeing Israeli schools need to raise their standards,
technology entrepreneur Jon Medved doesn&#8217;t think Israel&#8217;s test scores
tell the whole story. He says informal education, through the
military, youth movements, and extracurricular activities, builds
skills. He also praised programs for gifted&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>Consequently, Medved says he isn&#8217;t worried that Israel&#8217;s tech-driven
economy will slide because of deficiencies in the school&nbsp;system.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>While I think it&#8217;s important to sound alarm signals, I haven&#8217;t heard
from tech companies &#8230; &#8216;the employees we&#8217;re getting are not
educated,&#8217;&#8221; Medved&nbsp;said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two thoughts came to mind. First, we certainly are hearing in the United
States that employers are unhappy with the caliber of candidates for
open positions. It&#8217;s unclear that in the <span class="caps">US</span> this is a result of low
aggregate skills or just tremendous mismatch between the skills that are
attained and the skills that are now valued in the marketplace. Second,
Israel&#8217;s universal military service provides several additional years of
intense training and skill attainment even before college. Considering
the broad range of roles one can take on in the state military ((For
example, social workers in Israel are basically military trained, given
job experience, and then set out without a need for 5 years of
schooling, although I believe many do receive at least a bachelor&#8217;s)),
it&#8217;s hard not to see Israel&#8217;s mandatory service as a massive vocational
educational&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much analysis here, but mandatory public/civil service is
an interesting concept that this article will keep me thinking about
over the&nbsp;weekend.</p>
