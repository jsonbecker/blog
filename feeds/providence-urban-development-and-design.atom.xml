&lt;p&gt;Seriously, I am quite optimistic about the once-in-a-generation to develop a massive part of what should be an integral part of Providence&amp;#8217;s downtown core &lt;sup id="fnref:core"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:core" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Buildings will come, even if it is a slow, grueling process. Hopefully jobs will follow. But a key first step the incredibly busy &lt;sup id="fnref:busy"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:busy" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I-195 commission must take is elevating Dyer Street to a new hub of&amp;nbsp;activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Dyer&amp;nbsp;Street&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly important site for the redevelopment of Providence. One of the highest profile completed development projects in the Jewelry District has been &lt;a href="http://brown.edu/academics/medical/"&gt;Brown University&amp;#8217;s Alpert Medical School&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://med.brown.edu/newbuilding/"&gt;Ship Street and Eddy Street&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:dyertoeddy"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dyertoeddy" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Further down Eddy Street, we find one of the tragic
failures of the Jewelry District, &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/woneffe/4371630714/sizes/l/in/photostream/"&gt;Narragansett Electric Lighting&lt;/a&gt; (Dynamo House), a hulking brick site left open to the elements that was set at one point to become a museum. &lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/?ll=41.816875,-71.40651&amp;amp;spn=100.50313,204.433594&amp;amp;hnear=385+Westminster+St,+Providence,+Rhode+Island+02903&amp;amp;t=v&amp;amp;z=3&amp;amp;layer=c&amp;amp;panoid=iH5omOmwEwV_aAhyccIScQ&amp;amp;cbll=41.816875,-71.40651&amp;amp;cbp=13,28.53329819751501,,0,-6.703606203030631"&gt;One Davol Square&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.ri-cie.org/start-incubator/start-incubator"&gt;popular site for entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt; in Providence is found where Eddy meets Point&amp;nbsp;Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown University has already purchased 200 Dyer Street, which sits to the north at the &amp;#8220;start&amp;#8221; of Dyer Street between Clinton and Dorrance. This site was recently renovated and is now home to &lt;a href="http://brown.edu/ce/"&gt;Brown University&amp;#8217;s Continuing Education&lt;/a&gt;, an adult education site primarily mid-career professionals and adults. Already 200 Dyer hosts forums intended for the Providence community and, along with expanding &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt; into so-called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/proposed-executive-master-s-program-would-diversify-revenue-streams-1.2718694"&gt;executive master&amp;#8217;s programs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;, this site is likely to be a hub of substantial interaction between Brown and Providence&amp;nbsp;residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see that Eddy Street, from Ship Street to Point Street, is already an important hub of job-related activity in the Jewelry District. The very presence of an existing, huge, historic site between
Alpert Medical School and a major center for startups makes it likely that this stretch could see real further development. And with Brown staking claim to the &amp;#8220;mouth&amp;#8221; of Dyer Street, the makings of a Brown University &amp;#8220;West&amp;#8221; campus &lt;sup id="fnref:campuswest"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:campuswest" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is coming into&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding Riverwalk Park into the space between Dorrance and Ship Street as planned should be the final piece to the Dyer Street puzzle &lt;sup id="fnref:puzzle"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:puzzle" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that turning Dyer Street into an &amp;#8220;A&amp;#8221; street filled with activity should be one of the easiest sells of all in the Jewelry District, given this is one of the few areas where actual purchases have taken place other than the land behind Johnson and&amp;nbsp;Wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, as far as I can tell, Providence Planning&amp;#8217;s vision for the repairing of the street grid in this area is right on the mark, because while the land adjacent to Dyer Street from Friendship Street to Ship Street is some of the most &amp;#8220;shovel-ready&amp;#8221; land in the Jewelry District, this stretch also represents some of the most obviously damaged by the highway &lt;sup id="fnref:highway"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:highway" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is easily fixed. Dyer Street should be two ways all the way and not shift to a one-way at Peck Street. The remnants of an &amp;#8220;on&amp;#8221; ramp that serves as the northbound route connecting Ship Street and Peck Street should obviously be eliminated and subsumed in the expanded Riverwalk Park. An additional oddity left from another on ramp between Dorrance and Clifford Street should be removed, allowing the two-way Dyer to have a straighter path. Dyer should potentially be expanded to include bike lanes separated from traffic by trees on the eastern&amp;nbsp;side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chapinero, Bogotá Bike Path via Wikipedia" src="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/images/Chapinero_bike_path.jpg" title="Chapinero Bike Path" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a street like this. Encourage development on the west led by Brown University connecting Alpert Medical School to Brown Continuing Education. Bring in creative commercial development forming a continuous street wall of jobs from One Davol Square to the new, expanded park. Attach the proposed Greenway through the Jewelry District and the planned pedestrian bridge to Fox Point. Do all of this, and Dyer Street will become one of the most vibrant &lt;em&gt;places&lt;/em&gt; in&amp;nbsp;Providence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:core"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not being sarcastic here, even if I&amp;#8217;m generally dismissive and flippant about the wacky ideas that the &amp;#8220;elite&amp;#8221; in Providence and the state of Rhode Island have about this space&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:core" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:busy"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so here I&amp;#8217;m being sarcastic&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:busy" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:campuswest"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think they use this term&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:campuswest" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:puzzle"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it appears the I-195 commission is getting cold feet on the expanse of this public space&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:puzzle" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:highway"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will likely help to look at &lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/?ll=41.820716,-71.407483&amp;amp;spn=0.003274,0.006239&amp;amp;hnear=385+Westminster+St,+Providence,+Rhode+Island+02903&amp;amp;t=v&amp;amp;z=18"&gt;this view&lt;/a&gt; while reading this next section&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:highway" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Due to the recent, and new, requirement that residents reapply for their homestead tax exemption in Providence, I decided to poke around the Providence webpage to see what kind of &lt;a href="http://providence.ias-clt.com/parcel.list.php"&gt;public information on property was available online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was greeted with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; nightmare&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system was clearly a third-party developed or purchased front end designed for searching public records on property and sold to municipalities throughout the country by winning contracts through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFP&lt;/span&gt; process. It&amp;#8217;s also clearly no longer supported (or supported poorly), outdated, and running on hardware that&amp;#8217;s probably about as powerful as an 8-year-old desktop computer. The system crawls, when it&amp;#8217;s not completely still, and provides no means of easy export that I can&amp;nbsp;find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was really disappointing to me. In an earlier post, I began to look at some simple data available on the Providence Journal&amp;#8217;s webpage about recent sales. I was hoping to use an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; (and in the worst case, a massive data dump) to get access to information about the assessed value of recently sold properties and to play around a bit with various heat maps and see what patterns are revealed. Even if there were some way to get access to the data, the application is so poor I definitely do not have the&amp;nbsp;patience required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a real shame, because one of the great things about data on property is that it is all public information. This means that the data could be shared widely to creative policy wonks, data geeks, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; nerds looking for a weekend project. There are now two cities&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; that are employing a &lt;a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2012/03/dawn-muncipal-chief-innovation-officer/1516"&gt;new kind of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212; the Chief &lt;em&gt;Innovation&lt;/em&gt; Officer&amp;#8212; whose role is to connect government resources, be they employees, data, or infrastructure, with folks who can do something new, exciting, and useful for city&amp;nbsp;residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers designed one application in San Francisco to reduce the &amp;#8220;notoriously cumbersome hurdles for starting a new business.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Does anyone happen to know of another city, perhaps without the rich, entrepreneurial technology and science economy it lusts for, that is not known as an easy place to set up shop? &lt;a href="http://www.providenceri.com"&gt;Hint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Brown University has an excellent computer science department made up of undergrads who work on side projects like &lt;a href="http://brown.mochacourses.com"&gt;developing an online course catalog&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/2.12225/ucs-criticizes-new-banner-course-catalog-1.1674252#.T2frNWJSRe8"&gt;Brown purchased system sucks&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s hard not to conclude that there are latent geek talents just waiting to be tapped. And it&amp;#8217;s not just Brown that could be engaged. What about &lt;a href="http://swipely.com/"&gt;Swipely&lt;/a&gt;, the newest tech startup from entrepreneur &lt;a href="http://angusdavis.com/"&gt;Angus Davis&lt;/a&gt;, a Rhode Island native who is very active in local government and developing Providence. An exciting. fledging technology company with young, smart folks who do application development with huge swaths of data every day is an excellent source of the kind of talent Providence needs. Why hasn&amp;#8217;t someone approached Swipely about a charity opportunity&amp;#8212; take all non-essential staff off their current projects, give them a break from the deadlines and typical day, and get them working furiously for a week on rolling out something awesome and useful for city residents. It would reinvigorate young coders and greatly benefit the&amp;nbsp;city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, something as simple as getting in and teaching government employees how to spin up instances of &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/"&gt;Amazon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so they can migrate off self-managed, slow servers for non-secure information would be huge. Imagine this, plus rolling an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; for critical municipal data sets. There would be a rich environment for hobbyists, students, and professionals alike to spark some creative ways to understand and interact with&amp;nbsp;Providence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example, assuming it&amp;#8217;s legal, how long do you think it would take a smart developer, dedicated solely to one task, to roll a system that would cross-reference Providence landowners with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DMV&lt;/span&gt; registration database so that myself and other residents didn&amp;#8217;t have to trek out documentation to City Hall to avoid a 50% tax&amp;nbsp;hike?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providence is not San Francisco, but there are many talented developers and data scientists who are passionate enough about the city to donate their time and expertise. Honestly, for many of these folks there are real personal benefits, even without appealing to some sentiment of civic duty. So let&amp;#8217;s open up our data, our infrastructure, and our employees. Let&amp;#8217;s encourage folks from outside of government to inject excitement and new skills for current government &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; employees and&amp;nbsp;analysts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s time for Providence&amp;#8217;s own &amp;#8220;Summer of&amp;nbsp;Code&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty disappointed, but not surprised, that Bank of America &lt;a href="http://www.pbn.com/Bank-of-America-to-vacate-Superman-building-,64983"&gt;has chosen to leave&lt;/a&gt; 111 Westminster Street. The building is an iconic anchor to downtown Providence. Unfortunately, this space has not been properly refurbished to more modern standards. The entire building has a single, antiquated utilities system&amp;#8212; heating, cooling, electricity, etc are all setup for a single tenant. Weighing in at 350,000 square feet, there is simply no one in Providence who needs an old, out of date workspace of that size. Renovations, at this point, are likely to be very expensive, although &lt;a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/housing/2012/01/why-most-environmental-building-building-weve-already-built/1016/"&gt;environmental advocates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/buildings/costume-jewelry-factory-will-become-browns-medical-school-saving-35-million/26293"&gt;businessmen&lt;/a&gt; alike should unite around refurbishing over &lt;a href="http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2011/11/21/195_redevelopment.JPG"&gt;new construction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downtown Providence &lt;sup id="fnref:downcity"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:downcity" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has no shortage of &lt;a href="http://www.pbn.com/2011-turning-point-for-commercial-real-estate,63603?category_id=79&amp;amp;sub_type=stories,packages"&gt;vacant space&lt;/a&gt;. Saving 111 Westminster is going to take creative thinking and substantial investment. Fortunately, there is no better time since the &lt;a href="http://www.gcpvd.org/2012/01/20/the-arcade-are-you-kidding-me-with-this/"&gt;Arcade is undergoing some exciting changes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;sup id="fnref:arcade"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:arcade" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the near perfect alignment of 111 Westminster and the Arcade,
I&amp;#8217;d love to see some true, deep collaboration that rethinks the area on
Westminster Street between Exchange and Dorrance Streets &lt;sup id="fnref:dorrance"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dorrance" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Activating this space at the street level will be a huge boon to the Arcade, 111 Westminster, and the success of Downtown as a whole. I&amp;#8217;ve got a handful of ideas, but I lack the skills to make beautiful pictures to make my visions&amp;nbsp;tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;m going to just have to hope that &lt;a href="http://www.gcpvd.org"&gt;Greater City: Providence&lt;/a&gt; recognizes this as the opportunity for a new &lt;a href="http://www.gcpvd.org/category/features/reboot/"&gt;Reboot&lt;/a&gt;, my personal favorite work on the site. In their&amp;nbsp;words,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REBOOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an occasional series of posts on &lt;em&gt;Greater City:
Providence&lt;/em&gt; where we identify areas of the city that display poor
urbanism and propose ways to improve them. Our interventions may be
simple and quite easily realized, or they may at times be grand and
possibly take years or decades to complete. Either way, we hope they
generate interest and&amp;nbsp;discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past Reboot&amp;#8217;s have featured the &lt;a href="http://www.gcpvd.org/2011/06/08/reboot-providence-train-station/"&gt;Providence Train Station&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.gcpvd.org/2010/08/17/reboot-olneyville-square/"&gt;Olneyville Square&lt;/a&gt;, among others. Let&amp;#8217;s Reboot 111 Westminster and the Arcade, and the whole area east of Dorrance &lt;sup id="fnref:110west"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:110west" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original title of this post was unintentionally, overly similar to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GCPVD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s post on this issue. I recognized this oversight independently and have edited the&amp;nbsp;title.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:downcity"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am desperately trying to drop &amp;#8220;Downcity&amp;#8221; in favor of &amp;#8220;Downtown&amp;#8221; after training myself to say Downcity.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:downcity" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:arcade"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#8217;ve been cranky about the Arcade plans, but I think that&amp;#8217;s more about my general mood than the merits of the redevelopment. It could work, and if it does, it will be very exciting for Downtown.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:arcade" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:dorrance"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d love to see traffic closed along both Weybosset and Westminster from Memorial Boulevard down to Dorrance.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:dorrance" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:110west"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And 110 Westminster, while we&amp;#8217;re at it, the massive condo tower-turned parking lot&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:110west" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This morning, I decided to try out two first&amp;#8212; importing a table of data that is being read of the web and overlaying location data onto a&amp;nbsp;map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little bit of Google skills and just enough R know-how I was able to produce this&amp;nbsp;image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Providence Home Sales 9-12-11 to 12-27-11" src="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/images/homesales.png" title="Providence Home Sales 9-12-11 to 12-27-11" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few things that were kind of tricky for me. First, for sometime I couldn&amp;#8217;t get latitude and longitude components for the addresses. I figured there was something wrong with the way I was using the *apply class of functions in R. apply() (and the related class of functions lapply, sapply, etc.) are really handy if a bit tricky for beginning R users. This function permits quickly &amp;#8220;applying&amp;#8221; a function across multiple elements. Traditionally this is done with a loop, but the apply() functions &amp;#8220;vectorize&amp;#8221; this process (R folks always talk about making your code more vectorized which has something to do with the structure of objects in R but is beyond my computer science skills&amp;#8212; essentially, vectorized code runs much faster and more efficiency than loops because of some underlying feature of the language). After playing around with apply, lapply, and sapply, I decided to move back into my &amp;#8220;old&amp;#8221; way of thinking and just write a&amp;nbsp;loop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;latlongroll &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;address&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  lat &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; vector&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;mode &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;numeric&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; length &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; length&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;address&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  lng &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; vector&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;mode &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;numeric&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; length &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; length&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;address&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class="kr"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;address&lt;span class="p"&gt;)){&lt;/span&gt;
    latlong &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; gGeoCode&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;address&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    lat&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;latlong&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    lng&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;latlong&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cbind&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;lat&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;lng&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This still didn&amp;#8217;t work&amp;#8212; I kept on getting a strange out-of-bounds call. So I decided to go down the rabbit hole of regular expressions and try and see if I could clean up my addresses any further (I couldn&amp;#8217;t). So, now seemed as good a time as any to figure out how to print to the console while a loop is running to keep track of progress and where exactly my function was stopped. This turned out to be a bit tricky because I didn&amp;#8217;t know you had to include a tricky line, &lt;code&gt;r flush.console()&lt;/code&gt; in order to get the prints to work. When I figured this out I found out my loop was being caught on my 7th element, a perfectly well formed address. When I ran gGeoCode() on that address only it worked fine. So I thought, maybe Google is bouncing me out because I&amp;#8217;m hitting it too fast? And bingo, the final (working&amp;nbsp;version):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;latlongroll &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;address&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
 lat &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; vector&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;mode &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;numeric&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; length &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; length&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;address&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
 lng &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; vector&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;mode &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;numeric&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; length &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; length&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;address&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kr"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;i &lt;span class="kr"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;address&lt;span class="p"&gt;)){&lt;/span&gt;
  print&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  flush.console&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  latlong &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; gGeoCode&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;address&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
  lat&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;latlong&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  lng&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;latlong&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  Sys.sleep&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="kr"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cbind&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;lat&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;lng&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Other than that, the whole process was pretty straight forward. I have to thank Tony Breyal for &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3257441/geocoding-in-r-with-google-maps"&gt;posting the functions I used&lt;/a&gt; to get latitude and longitude on &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;. Also, I found the &lt;a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RgoogleMaps/vignettes/RgoogleMaps-intro.pdf"&gt;RgoogleMaps vignette&lt;/a&gt; to be very helpful, although I wish it had slightly better explained what was going on in&amp;nbsp;qbbox().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, my full source for the&amp;nbsp;above:&lt;/p&gt;

There are really just
two things I don&amp;#8217;t understand about the &lt;a href="http://providencecoreconnector.com/"&gt;Core Connector&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s proposal.
I&amp;#8217;m going to tackle one in this&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the entire streetcar route shared with general traffic with no
dedicated right-of-way? Truthfully, this isn&amp;#8217;t a massive issue except in
the core part of Downcity where there is substantial traffic during rush
hours along the street car route. But this makes the plan even more
perplexing because it&amp;#8217;s precisely this portion of the route where an
obvious solution for dedicated light rail &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROW&lt;/span&gt; exists- Westminster&amp;nbsp;Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Quick and dirty Core Connector modification" src="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/images/Route-November-3.png" title="CoreConnectorRouteModified" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red route above represents the proposed streetcar line. The green
line represents Westminster Street, a narrow, single lane, one-way
street that cuts through Downcity and in front of &lt;a href="http://suraprovidence.com/"&gt;restaurants&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.queenofheartsandmodernlove.com/"&gt;boutique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.shopwarf.com"&gt;shopping&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.uri.edu/prov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, etc. It brings the streetcar line
slightly closer to Johnson and Wales and slightly further from the
Dunkin Donuts Arena and Rhode Island Convention Center. While there is
real automobile traffic, this is almost entirely for two reasons. First,
Westminster has substantial on-street metered parking. Second,
Westminster is the East-&gt;West one-way to counter Weybosset&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;West-East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the two major Downcity planning projects underway are
removing the stress that leads to both of these uses. The Downtown
Circulator project is nearly complete, converting Empire and Weybosset
to two-way streets. Automobile traffic will almost certainly take the
wider and faster Washington and Weybosset Streets, adjacent to
Westminster, unless the goal is to find on the street parking. The
second project is the Core Connector itself, which provides more options
to get into Downcity without a car, hopefully reducing the need for
parking. There are also substantial parking capacity that&amp;#8217;s
underutilized in the many surface lots and parking garages in the&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A great shot from Flickr of Westminster at night" src="http://blog.jasonpbecker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/4256071978_aaf18cb143_z.jpg" title="Westminster at Night" /&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:sourceone"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sourceone" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, there is really no need for Westminster to have
street traffic. A dedicated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROW&lt;/span&gt; will increase the speed and
predictability of the streetcar. Additional pedestrian space along
Westminster could quickly be used by the cafes and restaurants and
street vendors that already are in the area. The only reason I could
come up with for not using Westminster as a dedicated right-of-way for
the streetcar is the need for a turn in or around Kennedy Plaza. There
are so many options for moving between Washington and Westminster that I
just can&amp;#8217;t buy this as an insurmountable&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was unable to make it to the three recent public meetings about the
proposed route. If I were there, this would certainly be my first&amp;nbsp;question.&lt;/p&gt;

The official route and payment options have now been proposed, as reported in the &lt;a href="http://www.projo.com/news/content/STREETCAR_PLAN_09-26-11_UAQI5KV_v15.6c71c.html"&gt;Projo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Route&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m pleased to see that they prioritized frequent service through the main ridership areas (College Hill to Jewelry District and hospital) were prioritized over service to the train station. Jef Nickerson says it best over at &lt;a href="http://www.gcpvd.org/2011/09/26/streetcars-the-train-station-is-out-but-thats-ok/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GCPVD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212; the train station is out-of-the-way and would dramatically increase rider time while having unclear implications for ridership, and the station is already very well served (and could easily be better served) by existing bus routes. The streetcar is really about moving people within Providence and providing a permanency to the connectivity between the current (Brown and hospital) and hopefully future (Jewelry District) economic engines of the&amp;nbsp;city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed route uses Washington and Empire Street&amp;#8212; both are wise choices. Washington Street adds the &lt;a href="http://www.providencebiltmore.com/"&gt;Biltmore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lupos.com/"&gt;Lupos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.uri.edu/prov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org/about/the-mercantile-block.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AS220&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; directly to the route while keeping the &lt;a href="http://www.riconvention.com/"&gt;Convention Center&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.dunkindonutscenter.com/"&gt;Dunk&lt;/a&gt; near by. Washington also has the advantage of a direct route over 95 for a possible South-Westward expansion in the future with limited cost and slow downs due to a lack of turns. Empire Street is also a great choice. The road is only about to undergo construction to be expanded for two-way traffic (one of the last legs of the Downtown Circulator project). The corner of Washington and Empire anchors the streetcar at the &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/"&gt;Providence Central Library&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.trinityrep.com/"&gt;Trinity Rep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AS220&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://38studios.com/"&gt;38 Studios&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.projo.com/economy/HASBRO_LASALLE_SQUARE_07-19-11_EMP8O4D_v19.42183.html"&gt;Hasbro&amp;#8217;s new Downcity location&lt;/a&gt;. Regency Plaza adds more residential ridership and the massive parking lot across from the Hilton suddenly looks more attractive for infill development. It doesn&amp;#8217;t hurt that I live at Westminster and Empire and would be excellently served by this location. Overall, I believe this path through Downcity is the easiest to manage while anchoring the streetcar near major hubs of activity. I only wish they could have found a way to bring the streetcar down Westminster and close the street to personal vehicle traffic, but that was never a likely&amp;nbsp;option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewelry District part of the route never seemed as controversial to me because there were limited solutions that  were somewhat obvious. The decision to use Chestnut makes sense and solidifies the Westminster-Chestnut Street path as a strong North-South connector through the area. Not going all the way to Prairie Avenue is likely going to anger some Upper South Providence residents, but I&amp;#8217;m not convinced this is a bad thing. At the &lt;a href="http://blog.jasonpbecker.com/2011/09/08/community-voice-at-the-knowledge-district-development-framework-meeting/"&gt;Knowledge District Development Framework meeting&lt;/a&gt; it was clear that increasing paucity between the two sides of Prairie Avenue was a major goal of development in the hospital area. Forcing people to walk a bit on Dudley Street may generate the kind of foot traffic needed to make infill in that area with first floor retail a lot more&amp;nbsp;attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m in favor of it. This one is a no-brainer in my mind. Property values will certainly increase in the areas being served by the streetcar and therefore current owners stand to have some significant gains in equity if this project moves forward. The attractiveness of living where I am has increased tremendously for Brown faculty and staff, medical students, and some of the entrepreneurs and their employees if they ever materialize in the Jewelry District. That I should have to contribute some of this gained equity back to get the project built makes sense. The question is, will the requested tax be too high to be worth it? So let&amp;#8217;s do the math. The proposal will hit me with \$0.95 on every \$1,000 of property value. Let&amp;#8217;s assume that the homestead exemption will not be applied to this tax. Let&amp;#8217;s also assume that I&amp;#8217;m looking at a 15 year stay Downcity. This is reasonable because most of the properties around here are condos that are one or two bedroom and are not attractive to
folks with families&amp;#8212; we&amp;#8217;re filled with young folks and empty-nesters who aren&amp;#8217;t likely to be looking at this like a 30 year investment. Let&amp;#8217;s also assume that the economy will continue to stagnate over this period so we only see an inflation rate of, say, 2%. It&amp;#8217;s likely that this is an overly pessimistic estimate that will increase the cost. What I&amp;#8217;m interested in is the present discounted value, or the cost to me due to this tax if I were to incur it all up front. The theory goes that money today is worth more than money tomorrow because money depreciates in value due to inflation and because money today can be invested and will grow over time. We calculate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDV&lt;/span&gt; much like you would calculate compound interest. The final piece of data to calculate the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDV&lt;/span&gt; needed is my home value. Let&amp;#8217;s assume it hasn&amp;#8217;t moved at all since I purchased about a year ago, which would peg my condo at \$168,000. Now I want to know if
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDV&lt;/span&gt; of the tax will exceed what I believe is a reasonable estimate for the increase in equity I will realize because of the project. 
And the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDV&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;is&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\$2,050.74&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it would be hard to argue that my property value won&amp;#8217;t increase at least 1.2% because of this project. Adding the line, &amp;#8220;Steps to the Providence Streetcar that will take you to Brown&amp;#8217;s Medical School, through the Knowledge District, and to the Hospitals or through Downcity to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RISD&lt;/span&gt; and Brown,&amp;#8221; is going to be worth more than that, period. I can&amp;#8217;t imagine the calculus is dramatically different for other Downcity property owners which means for us, this makes&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;cents&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="brown university"></category><category term="core connector"></category><category term="department of planning and development"></category><category term="jewelry district"></category><category term="knowledge district"></category><category term="providence"></category><category term="ri"></category><category term="streetcar"></category><category term="urban development"></category></entry><entry><title>Community Voice at the Knowledge District Development Framework Meeting</title><link href="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/2011/09/community-voice-at-the-knowledge-district-development-framework-meeting.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-09-08T03:50:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason</name></author><id>tag:blog.jsonbecker.com,2011-09-08:2011/09/community-voice-at-the-knowledge-district-development-framework-meeting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I went to a public meeting run by Providence&amp;#8217;s Department of Planning and Development. A few of upfront&amp;nbsp;observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The folks who work for the Department of Planning and Development (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DPD&lt;/span&gt;) were professional, kind, and capable, as was the consultants who worked with them. They maintained decorum and a genuine sense of openness even though there was a clear tension in the room between some outspoken (and knowledgeable) community members and activists who had clearly participated in many past&amp;nbsp;meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ideas presented for the Knowledge District demonstrated thoughtful, albeit top-down, considerations for the space that showed a remarkable respect for the complexity, size, and importance of the project. I also felt that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DPD&lt;/span&gt; and their consultants got all the big ideas right and that they were quite familiar with the community they were&amp;nbsp;re-imagining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite some great big ideas, there are really important details that are worth memorializing that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DPD&lt;/span&gt; is missing. In part, maybe this is because they&amp;#8217;re simply not at that deep a stage. I&amp;#8217;m hopeful that the purpose of the public meetings was not just to get
feedback on the big concepts (which seem largely unassailable), but to make sure they get the details right from the people who live and interact with these neighborhoods&amp;nbsp;daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some clear areas of consensus among the engaged community, both positive and negative. At times, this consensus suggest that the state, city, and institutions (business, education, health, etc) have very different goals than the community.
∫
Here&amp;#8217;s my summary of what the community had to&amp;nbsp;say:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks want to get rid of surface parking lots and move towards more parking structures. It&amp;#8217;s very clear that everyone feels these surface lots contribute to the desolate feel of the Jewelry District and hospital area, as well as acting as an extra barrier (beyond the highways) to connecting the Knowledge District to the rest of the city. People want to see mixed-use, with real action on the street level and residences and offices on higher floors. Everyone wants better sight lines to draw people into the Jewelry district and wants to see green space embraced, not solely through a park on the water but intimately placed directly on the streets as trees and other landscaping. People cited Chestnut and Richmond Street  several times as strong streets that acted as the main arteries by which Downcity and the Jewelry District connect. It seems that there is broad agreement that there a reason needs to exist to draw pedestrians into this neighborhood from Downcity, Fox Point, and Upper South Providence if we&amp;#8217;re going to have a vital, 24/7 community. There was also pretty broad acceptance of higher buildings being constructed along I-95 and keeping large footprint buildings out of the Jewelry&amp;nbsp;District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the more negative tone of the evening came from two core issues&amp;#8212; the need for more residential development, something that&amp;#8217;s not seen as high priority or even on the radar of most public officials, and funding. I&amp;#8217;ll start with funding. There are serious concerns that even if the plans are perfect and great, a total lack of municipal, state, and federal funding for the foreseeable future places major risks on central aspects of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DPD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s plans. How can we fund a large, sweeping greenway and inviting, beautiful streets? How can we fund restoring vital roadways absorbed by bad planning in the past? How can we upkeep the parks people crave or build vital family institutions like schools without any public funding? How will we repurpose landmark
buildings like the Dynamo House that has sat vacant even though it&amp;#8217;s so full of potential? There is a serious sense that all the projects that serve as good models for the Knowledge District required considerable public infrastructure investment that&amp;#8217;s just not available now. Sadly, to truly &amp;#8220;fix&amp;#8221; the Knowledge District will require not just one large project, but several major improvements. I saw little optimism for the proposed Streetcar/light rail system that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIPTA&lt;/span&gt; is championing. Some of that was disbelief that it could ever be funded, and some of that was disbelief the streetcar was a solution to a real problem. There&amp;#8217;s also little optimism that the proposed pedestrian bridge to connect Fox Point to the Jewelry District is going to happen. Everyone begrudged that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DPD&lt;/span&gt; had little real authority to make anything happen. Zoning is an absolute disgrace in Providence, particularly this area. But even substantially improving the zoning and regulations around development won&amp;#8217;t actually make sure the projects are mindful of the projects wider goals. More to the point, it&amp;#8217;s still unclear how Providence can simply use the name &amp;#8220;Knowledge District&amp;#8221; to bring in the kind of development needed. There is serious consternation that the entire &amp;#8220;Knowledge District&amp;#8221; concept is selling something that doesn&amp;#8217;t exist and won&amp;#8217;t have the infrastructure to attract folks. Without the promise of big public infrastructure improvements, developers are going to play the &amp;#8220;wait and see&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residential development is another important aspect of what the community members craved. It was immediately clear that the desire of folks at this meeting was to have a 24/7 neighborhood with mixed-uses, including several calls (from residents, no less) to include low-income and affordable housing. There is strong dislike of the name &amp;#8220;Knowledge District&amp;#8221;, especially if it supplants the Jewelry District (which is a subset of the area in question). No one feels that this name captures what they want to use the space for, and no one felt the name had any
real meaning. Folks believed that &amp;#8220;Knowledge District&amp;#8221; was as empty marketing that would have no real longterm staying power. But really, this goes beyond a bad name. The members of the community who met with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DPD&lt;/span&gt; tonight clearly believe that residential development has taken a
major backseat to institutional expansion and large business development. My interpretation was that the community felt that lawmakers were simply hoping that big groups like the hospitals, Brown University, Johnson and Wales, and some yet-to-be-named mid-sized businesses would snap up parcels and build massive buildings that would fill with jobs. First, they believed this vision was largely a fiction (again, see the hesitation folks had that businesses of any remarkable
size would take on the development costs and move to Providence without the public infrastructure investments). Second, these kinds of buildings were not what the community envisioned, particularly for the Jewelry District area that already has much smaller plot sizes and lower building heights. What I heard, rather clearly, was that the sea of parking lots around the hospital and the area with raised highway along I-95 was fair game for the behemoth buildings most lawmakers are picturing for the entire project. But the interior of the Knowledge
District has to be filled in with a place that people want to live, play and work in (in that&amp;nbsp;order).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to write some more on my thoughts on developing this area in the future. I generally agree with the comments from the community above, but I have a bit more optimism and a bit more faith. Overall, I was really happy with how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DPD&lt;/span&gt; is framing this project. They are very consciously thinking about distinct portions of the Knowledge District and respecting their differences while simultaneously ensuring cohesion and setting strong, wider&amp;nbsp;goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just hope we get a damn grocery store and dramatically cut down on surface lots. More on that&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="brown university"></category><category term="department of planning and development"></category><category term="jewelry district"></category><category term="knowledge district"></category><category term="land use"></category><category term="providence"></category><category term="ri"></category><category term="urban development"></category></entry></feed>
