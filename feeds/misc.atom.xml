I love this as much as he does and would probably add several other provisions (like forfeiting any tax breaks on that property or any other property in the city and potentially forfeiture of the property itself if a demolition was approved based on site plans that are not adhered to within a given time frame). Ultimately, I do think the best solution to surface parking where it doesn&amp;#8217;t belong, of either the temporary or permanent (and isn&amp;#8217;t it all actually permanent?) kind, is a &lt;a href="http://streetsblog.net/2012/12/10/want-to-end-the-scourge-of-surface-parking-tax-land-not-buildings/"&gt;land value tax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James goes one step further and suggests that we should adopt some similar rules around &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; parking developments and proposes a few. His hopes were that a mayoral candidate would chime in. For now, he will have to do with&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His recommendations are built somewhat specific to the commission looking at building a state-funded parking garage in front of the &lt;a href="http://www.gcpvd.org/2013/10/24/projo-commission-meets-to-discuss-possible-garrahy-complex-parking-garage/"&gt;Garrahy Complex&lt;/a&gt; in Downcity, about which many urbanists and transit advocates have expressed reservations or outright rejection. They&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The garage is parking neutral. As many spots need to be removed from the downtown as are&amp;nbsp;added. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An added bonus would be if some of the spots removed were on-street ones, to create protected bike lanes or transit lanes with greenery separating them from car&amp;nbsp;traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The garage has the proposed bus&amp;nbsp;hub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are ground-level&amp;nbsp;shops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The garage is left open 24-hours so that it can limit the need for other lots (this happens when a garage is used only during the day, or only at night, instead of letting it serve both&amp;nbsp;markets).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cars pay full market price to&amp;nbsp;park.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: I&amp;#8217;ve numbered rather than kept the bullets of the original to make responding&amp;nbsp;easier.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree with the first and second point, which are really one and the same. We are in a district that has tremendously underutilized land. We want that space to be developed and as a result of that development we expect their to be much increased need for transit capacity. The goal should be &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; to increase accessibility &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; increase the share of transit capacity offered by walking, biking, or riding a bus or light rail. This does not require that we demand a spot-for-spot when building a public garage. I agree with the sentiment but disagree with the degree. Part of building rules and policies like this is to ensure comprehensive consideration of the transit context when developing parking. I see no reason to a priori assume that garages should only be permitted if they eliminate the same number of spaces they&amp;nbsp;create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I combine these two points is because the city does not have the ability to remove off-street parking that is not publicly owned. Investing in smaller garages by footprint that have to be built taller and provide no change in capacity probably make no sense at all. If we&amp;#8217;re going to build any kind of public garage at all, it should be with the goal of consolidating parking into infrastructure with reasonable land utilization. We would rather 3 or 4 large garages properly located than all of the current lots. Limiting their size because of the flexibility available due to reducing on-street parking or the footprint on existing lots doesn&amp;#8217;t achieve that and doesn&amp;#8217;t factor in orders-of-magnitude changes in capacity we should need for all transit modes in the next 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On point three, I am skeptical. I like the idea of improving bus infrastructure when building parking infrastructure in general. In fact, I voted against the \$40M Providence road paving bond even though that was much needed maintenance. My rationale was purely ideological&amp;#8212; we should not use debt to pay for car maintenance without also investing in ways to reduce future maintenance costs through better utilization of those roads. However, I have a hard time believing that the Garrahy location is any good as a bus hub. If &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIPTA&lt;/span&gt; did a great job identifying the need for an additional bus hub that the Garrahy location met the criteria for, I think it&amp;#8217;s a reasonable idea. Short of that, it feels like throwing the transit community a wasteful&amp;nbsp;bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mostly agree on point four, but I doubt at the scale James would like to see. I think an appropriate level is probably not that different from the recently erected Johnson and Wales garage. The reality is that street-level retail is the right form, but there isn&amp;#8217;t sufficient foot traffic to support it right now and won&amp;#8217;t be for some time. There has to be street-level activation of any garage built in this area, but the square footage is likely fairly&amp;nbsp;timid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I absolutely agree with point five, without qualification. Not a dime should be spent on a public parking spot that is closed at any point in time, anywhere in the city. I would actually ditto this for surface parking lots on commercial properties of any kind after business hours. Not only should they have to be open, they should have to provide signs indicating the hours of commercial activity when parking is restricted and the hours when parking is available to the public. These hours of operations should require board approval. Owners could choose to charge during these off hours, but cars must be able to access the&amp;nbsp;lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And point six should be a given for any public&amp;nbsp;parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real problem with Garrahy, in my opinion, is the cost is absurd, likely to be at least \$35,000 per space. There is plenty of existing parking, suggesting the demand right now is illusory and market rate for those spots right now means the investment is unlikely to ever be recovered. In a world with limited capacity for government spending on transit as a public good, I would rather subsidize transit infrastructure that benefits the poor and directly impacts the share of non-car transit as it increases capacity. Spending limited funds on parking infrastructure is ludicrous when demand isn&amp;#8217;t sufficient to recover the investment. We already more than sufficiently subsidize parking in the area. And of course, the &amp;#8220;study commission&amp;#8221; is not really a study&amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s a meeting convened by those who want the project to happen putting the required usual suspects in the room to tepidly rubber stamp it. At least that&amp;#8217;s my cynical&amp;nbsp;take.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Did public schools build economies, or did economies build public schools?</title><link href="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/2013/12/did-public-schools-build-economies-or-did-economies-build-public-schools.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-12-10T23:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Jason P.

&lt;p&gt;We find that public schools offered practically zero return education on the margin, yet they did enjoy significant political and financial support from local political elites, if they taught in the “right” language of&amp;nbsp;instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that both progressives and libertarians agree upon are that social goals of education are woefully underappreciated and considered in the current school reform discussion. Both school choice and local, democratic control of schools are reactions to centralization resulting in &amp;#8220;elites&amp;#8230; [selecting] the &amp;#8216;right&amp;#8217; language of&amp;nbsp;instruction.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am inclined to agree with&amp;nbsp;neither.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Calculating Age with Precision in R</title><link href="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/2013/12/calculating-age-with-precision-in-r.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-12-04T17:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Jason P.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out the original code below was pretty messed up. All kinds of little errors I didn&amp;#8217;t catch. I&amp;#8217;ve updated it below. There are a lot of options to refactor this further that I&amp;#8217;m currently considering. Sometimes it is really hard to know just how flexible something this big really should be. I think I am going to wait until I start developing tests to see where I land. I have a feeling moving toward a more test-driven work flow is going to force me toward a different&amp;nbsp;structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently updated the function I &lt;a href="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/2013/06/calculating-age-in-r.html"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about back in June that calculates the difference between two dates in days, months, or years in R. It is still surprising to me that &lt;code&gt;difftime&lt;/code&gt; can only return units from seconds up until weeks. I suspect this has to do with the challenge of properly defining a &amp;#8220;month&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;year&amp;#8221; as a unit of time, since these are&amp;nbsp;variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there was nothing wrong with the original function, it did irk me that it always returned an integer. In other words, function returned only complete months or years. If the start date was on &lt;code&gt;2012-12-13&lt;/code&gt; and the end date was on &lt;code&gt;2013-12-03&lt;/code&gt;, the function would return &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; years. Most of the time, this is the behavior I expect when calcuating age. But it is completely reasonable to want to include partial years or months, e.g. in the aforementioned example returning &lt;code&gt;0.9724605&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after several failed attempts because of silly errors in my algorithm, here is the final code. It will be released as part of &lt;a href="https://github.com/jknowles/eeptools/"&gt;eeptools 0.3&lt;/a&gt; which should be avialable on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRAN&lt;/span&gt; soon &lt;sup id="fnref:moves"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:moves" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;age_calc &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;dob&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; enddate&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;Sys.Date&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; units&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;months&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; precise&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;inherits&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;dob&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Date&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;inherits&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;enddate&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Date&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)){&lt;/span&gt;
    stop&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Both dob and enddate must be Date class objects&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  start &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; as.POSIXlt&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;dob&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  end &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; as.POSIXlt&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;enddate&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to call attention to these interesting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PISA&lt;/span&gt; results. &lt;a href="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/images/turnsout.mp3"&gt;Turns out&lt;/a&gt; that student anxiety in the United States is lower than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OECD&lt;/span&gt; average and belief in ability is higher &lt;sup id="fnref:definitions"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:definitions" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I thought that all of the moves in education since the start of standard&amp;#8217;s based reform were supposed to be generating tremendous anxiety and failing to produce students who had high sense of&amp;nbsp;self-efficacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that students in the United States were more likely to skip out on school dand this had a higher than typical impact on student performance. One interpretation of this could be that students are less engaged, but also that schooling activities do have a large impact on students rather than schools being of lesser importance than student&amp;nbsp;inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always had a hard time reconciling the calls for higher teacher pay and better work conditions and evidence that missing even just 10% of schooling has a huge impact on student outcomes with the belief that addressing other social inequities is the key way to achieve better outcomes for&amp;nbsp;kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all an exercise in nonsense. It is incredibly difficult to transfer findings from surveys across dramatical cultural differences. It is also hard to imagine what can be learned about the delivery of education in the dramatically different contexts that exists. The whole international comparison game seems like one big Rorschach test where the price of admission is leaving any understanding of culture, context, and external validity at the&amp;nbsp;door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: The use of color in this visualization is awful. There is a sense that they are trying to be &amp;#8220;value neutral&amp;#8221; with data that is ordinal in nature (above, same, or below), and in doing so chose two colors that are very difficult to distinguish between.&amp;nbsp;Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:definitions"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site describes prevalence of anxiety as, &amp;#8220;proportion of students who feel helpless when faced with math problems&amp;#8221; and belief in ability as, &amp;#8220;proportion of students who feel confident in their math abilitites&amp;#8221;. Note, based on these defitions, one might also think that either curricula were not so misaligned with international benchmarks or that we are already seeing the fruits of partial transition to Common Core. Not knowing the trend for this data, or some of the specifics about the collection instrument, makes that difficult to assess.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:definitions" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this paper is meant for national and state level policy-makers, and so my major quibble is I think this is much more valuable for a district-level audience. I am less bullish on the state&amp;#8217;s role in building comprehensive assessment systems. That&amp;#8217;s just my initial&amp;nbsp;reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accountability section is both less rich and less convincing than the assessment portion.

&lt;p&gt;“We are trying to work towards late-exit &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELL&lt;/span&gt; programs so (students) can learn the concepts in (their) native language,” Lusi said. Administrative goals have recently shifted to a focus on proficiency in both languages because bilingual education is preferred, she&amp;nbsp;added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instituting district-wide bilingual education would require funding to hire teachers certified in both languages and to buy dual-language materials, she&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure this is new. I am surprised there has not been a stronger effort to pass a legislative package in Rhode Island that provides both the policy framework and funding necessary to achieve universal bilinguage education for English language learners in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great advantages of transitioning to common standards&lt;sup id="fnref:CCSS"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:CCSS" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is there should be greater availability of curricular materials in languages other than English. I suspect most of what is needed for bilingual education is start up money for materials, curriculum supports and developments, and assessment materials. There are a few policy things that need to be in place, possibly around state exams, but also rules around flexible teacher assignment, hiring, and dismissal staffing needs dramatically&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone should be putting this package together. I suspect there would be broad&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Blasio and his advisers are still figuring out how much rent to charge well-funded charter schools, his transition team told me. “It would depend on the resources of the charter school or charter network,” he told &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WNYC&lt;/span&gt;, in early October. “Some are clearly very, very well resourced and have incredible wealthy backers. Others don’t. So my simple point was that programs that can afford to pay rent should be paying rent.” (In an October debate with the Republican candidate Joseph Lhota, he put it more bluntly: “I simply wouldn’t favor charters the way Mayor Bloomberg did because, in the end, our city rises or falls on our traditional public&amp;nbsp;schools.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My impression of DeBlasio was that he went around collecting every plausible complaint from every interest group that was mad at Bloomberg and promised whatever they wanted. There didn&amp;#8217;t really seem to be a coherent theory or any depth whatsoever to his policy&amp;nbsp;prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already working hard to confirm this&amp;nbsp;impression.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>More evidence for “mere facts”</title><link href="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/2013/11/more-evidence-for-mere-facts.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-11-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Jason P.

&lt;p&gt;To recap, the first study discussed above established that children from disadvantaged backgrounds know less about a topic (i.e., birds) than their middle-class peers. Next, in study two, the researchers showed that differences in domain knowledge influenced children’s ability to understand words out of context, and to comprehend a story. Moreover, poor kids — who also had more limited knowledge — perform worse on these tasks than did their middle class peers. But could additional knowledge be used to level the playing field for children from less affluent backgrounds? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In study three, the researchers held the children’s prior knowledge constant by introducing a fictitious topic — i.e., a topic that was sure to be unknown to both groups. When the two groups of children were assessed on word learning and comprehension related to this new domain, the researchers found no significant differences in how poor and middle-class children learned words, comprehended a story or made&amp;nbsp;inferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the &amp;#8220;old&amp;#8221; divides in education, from before the current crop of &amp;#8220;edreform&amp;#8221;, is whether or not content matters. Broadly, there are two camps, let&amp;#8217;s call them the &amp;#8220;Facts&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Skills&amp;#8221;, with the &amp;#8220;Skills&amp;#8221; camp clearly ahead in terms of mind&amp;nbsp;share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Skills&amp;#8221; is based on a fundamentally intuitive insight&amp;#8212; students need to know how to do things not about the things themselves. In many ways it is built on our common experience of forgetting facts over time. We need &lt;em&gt;21st century skills&lt;/em&gt;, not an accumulation of specific, privileged knowledge that fades over time. Whatever the latest technology, from encyclopedias to calculators through to Google, each generation decides that the tools that adults use end the necessity of knowing &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; things rather than knowing how to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very attractive. It seems to match our adult experiences accumulating knowledge and using it in our work. It seems to address students&amp;#8217; boredom with learning &lt;em&gt;irrelevant&lt;/em&gt; information. It leaves space for groups to advocate for teaching whatever content they want since everyone can argue that content is fundamentally limited in&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In classic &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/images/turnsout.mp3"&gt;turns out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; sense, however, the evidence keeps mounting that one must teach from the &amp;#8220;Facts&amp;#8221; approach to achieve the goals of the &amp;#8220;Skills&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turns out:&lt;/strong&gt; skills and knowledge do not transfer well across domains. There is little evidence that learning how to read literary fiction translates to reading technical manuals with comprehension. In other words, critical thinking is not really an independent ability free of domain context &lt;sup id="fnref:critthinking"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:critthinking" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In fact, experts are able to learn more quickly, but only in their domain and only when they have prior knowledge to use as scaffolding &lt;sup id="fnref:scaffold"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:scaffold" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turns out:&lt;/strong&gt; reading comprehension is strongly connected to whether or not students have prior knowledge (&amp;#8220;Facts&amp;#8221;) about the topic of the passage &lt;sup id="fnref:priorknowledge"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:priorknowledge" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Reading techniques only provide modest assistance for&amp;nbsp;comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turns out:&lt;/strong&gt; privileging skills over content may have a serious differential impact on disadvantaged children. A well-intentioned goal of achieving equity through equality has led many to advocate that we do a disservice to children of color and children in poverty because their schools have not as completely embraced a &amp;#8220;Skills&amp;#8221; world and are too focused on &amp;#8220;Facts&amp;#8221;. The problem is that deep disparities we see when these students enter schooling point to having less prior knowledge than their peers &lt;sup id="fnref:culturalliteracy"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:culturalliteracy" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is remarkable, and tragic, is that the &amp;#8220;Skills&amp;#8221; camp has maintained its dominance through the demonization of &amp;#8220;Facts&amp;#8221;, with dramatic misinterpretations&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#8220;Facts&amp;#8221; folks are just White colonialists seeking to maintain existing power structures through teaching the information of&amp;nbsp;privilege.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#8220;Facts&amp;#8221; folks privilege memorization, rote learning, and recall-based assessment over other pedagogy that is more engaging and&amp;nbsp;authentic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#8220;Facts&amp;#8221; folks can only ever teach what was important yesterday; &amp;#8220;Skills&amp;#8221; camp can teach what matters to become a lifelong learner for tomorrow&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting list. I don&amp;#8217;t agree with number four. There are several benefits to using property taxes not the least of which is their stability and lagged response during traditional economic downturns. However, there are many things we should do to reform our revenue system for education. I am keen on &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; taxes on &amp;#8220;property&amp;#8221;, using land value taxes that are levvied either statewide or regionally to address some of the inequities traditional, highly localized property taxes can lead&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>It’s Poverty Stupid… or is it?</title><link href="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/2013/11/its-poverty-stupid-or-is-it.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-11-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Jason P.

I am currently soliciting responses from other data professionals across the country. But when I needed to produce mobility numbers for some of my work a couple of months ago, I decided to develop a set of business rules without any exposure to how the federal government, states, or other existing systems define mobility. &lt;sup id="fnref:ignorance"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ignorance" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fairly proud of my work on mobility. This post will review how I defined student mobility. I am hopeful that it matches or bests current techniques for calculating the number of schools a student has attended. In my next post, I will share the first two major versions of my implementation of these mobility business rules in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;sup id="fnref:learningexperience"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:learningexperience" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Together, these posts will represent the work I referred to in my previous post on the &lt;a href="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/2013/09/documentation-of-business-rules-and-analysis.html"&gt;importance of documenting business rules and sharing code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with district data presents a woefully incomplete picture of the education mobile students receive. Particularly in a state like Rhode Island, where our districts are only a few miles wide, there is substantial interdistrict mobility. When a student moves across district lines, their enrollment is not recorded in local district data. However, even with state level data, highly mobile students cross state lines and present incomplete data. A key consideration for calculating how many schools a student has attended in a particular year is capturing &amp;#8220;missing&amp;#8221; data&amp;nbsp;sensibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical structure of enrollment records looks something like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Unique Student &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;School Code&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Enrollment Date&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Exit Date&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012-09-01&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012-11-15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10103&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012-11-16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013-06-15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A compound key for this data consists of the Unique Student &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;, School Code, and Enrollment Date, meaning that each row must be a unique combination of these three factors. The data above shows a simple case of a student enrolling at the start of the school year, switching schools once with no gap in enrollment, and continuing at the new school until the end of the school year. For the purposes of mobility, I would define the above as having moved one&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is easy to see how some very complex scenarios could quickly arise. What if student &lt;code&gt;1000000&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#8216;s record looked like&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Unique Student &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;School Code&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Enrollment Date&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Exit Date&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012-10-15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2012-11-15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10103&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013-01-03&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013-03-13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10103&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013-03-20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2013-05-13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several features that make it challenging to assign a number of &amp;#8220;moves&amp;#8221; to this student. First, the student does not enroll in school until October 15, 2012. This is nearly six weeks into the typical school year in the Northeastern United States. Should we assume that this student has enrolled in no school at all prior to October 15th or should we assume that the student was enrolled in a school that was outside of this district and therefore missing in the data? Next, we notice the enrollment gap between November 15, 2012 and January 3, 2013. Is it right to assume that the student has moved only once in this period of time with a gap of enrollment of over a month and a half? Then we notice that the student exited school &lt;code&gt;10103&lt;/code&gt; on March 13, 2013 but was re-enrolled in the same school a week later on March 20, 2013. Has the student truly &amp;#8220;moved&amp;#8221; in this period? Lastly, the student exits the district on May 13, 2013 for the final time. This is nearly a month before the end of school. Has this student moved to a different&amp;nbsp;school?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an element missing that most enrollment data has which can enrich our understanding of this student&amp;#8217;s record. All district collect an exit type, which explains if a student is leaving to enroll in another school within the district, another school in a different district in the same state, another school in a different state, a private school, etc. It also defines whether a student is dropping out, graduating, or has entered the juvenile justice system, for example. However, it has been my experience that this data is reported inconsistently and unreliably. Frequently a student will be reported as changing schools within the district without a subsequent enrollment record, or reported as leaving the district but enroll within the same district a few days later. Therefore, I think that we should try and infer the number of schools that a student has attended using soley the enrollment date, exit date, and school code for each student record. This data is far more reliable for a host of reasons, and, ultimately, provides us with all the information we need to make intelligent&amp;nbsp;decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My proposed set of business rules examines &lt;code&gt;school code&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;enrollment date&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;exit date&lt;/code&gt; against three parameters: &lt;code&gt;enrollment by&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;exit by&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;gap&lt;/code&gt;. 
Each students minimum enrollment date is compared to &lt;code&gt;enrollment by&lt;/code&gt;. If that student entered the data set for the first time before the &lt;code&gt;enrollment by&lt;/code&gt;, the assumption is that this record represents the first time the student enrolls in any school for that year, and therefore the student has 0 &lt;code&gt;moves&lt;/code&gt;. If the student enrolls for the first time after &lt;code&gt;enrollment by&lt;/code&gt;, then the record is considered the second school a student has attended and their &lt;code&gt;moves&lt;/code&gt; attribute is incremented by &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly, if a student&amp;#8217;s maximium &lt;code&gt;exit date&lt;/code&gt; is after &lt;code&gt;exit by&lt;/code&gt;, then this considered to be the student&amp;#8217;s last school enrolled in for the year and they are credited with &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;moves&lt;/code&gt;, but if &lt;code&gt;exit date&lt;/code&gt; is prior to &lt;code&gt;exit by&lt;/code&gt;, then that student&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;moves&lt;/code&gt; is incremented by &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That takes care of the &amp;#8220;ends&amp;#8221;, but what happens as students switch schools in the &amp;#8220;middle&amp;#8221;? I proposed that each &lt;code&gt;exit date&lt;/code&gt; is compared to the subsequent &lt;code&gt;enrollment date&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;enrollment date&lt;/code&gt; occurs within &lt;code&gt;gap&lt;/code&gt; days of the previous &lt;code&gt;exit date&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;school code&lt;/code&gt; of enrollment is not the same as the &lt;code&gt;school code&lt;/code&gt; of exit, then a student&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;moves&lt;/code&gt; are incremented by &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. If the &lt;code&gt;school codes&lt;/code&gt; are identical and the difference between dates is less than &lt;code&gt;gap&lt;/code&gt;, then the student is said to have not moved at all. If the difference between the &lt;code&gt;enrollment date&lt;/code&gt; and the previous &lt;code&gt;exit date&lt;/code&gt; is greater than &lt;code&gt;gap&lt;/code&gt;, then the student&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;moves&lt;/code&gt; is incremented by &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;, the assumption being that the student likely attended a different school between the two observations in the&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas calculating student mobility may have seemed a simple matter of counting the number of records in the enrollment file, clearly there is a level of complexity this would fail to&amp;nbsp;capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check back in a few days to see my next post where I will share my initial implementation of these business rules and how I achieved an 10x speed up with a massive code&amp;nbsp;refactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:ignorance"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ignorance was intentional. It is good to stretch those brain muscles that think through sticky problems like developing business rules for a key statistic. I can&amp;#8217;t be sure that I have developed the most considered and complete set of rules for mobility, which is why I&amp;#8217;m now soliciting other&amp;#8217;s views, but I am hopeful my solution is at least as good.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ignorance" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:learningexperience"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think showing my first two implementation of these business rules is an excellent opportunity to review several key design considerations when programming in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;. From version 1 to version 2 I achieved a 10x speedup due to a complete refactor that avoided &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops, used &lt;code&gt;data.table&lt;/code&gt;, and included some clever use of recursion.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:learningexperience" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Becker</name></author><id>tag:blog.jsonbecker.com,2013-09-13:2013/09/documentation-of-business-rules-and-analysis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most challenging aspects of being a data analyst is translating programmatic terms like &amp;#8220;student mobility&amp;#8221; into precise business rules. Almost any simple statistic involves a series of decisions that are often opaque to the ultimate users of that&amp;nbsp;statistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation of business rules is a critical aspect of a data analysts job that, in my experience, is often regrettably overlooked. If you have ever tried to reproduce someone else&amp;#8217;s analysis, asked different people for the same statistic, or tried to compare data from multiple years, you have probably encountered difficulties getting a consistent answer on standard statistics, e.g. how many students were proficient in math, how many students graduated in four years, what proportion of students were chronically absent? All too often documentation of business rules is poor or non-existent. The result is that two analysts with the same data will produce inconsistent statistics. This is not because of something inherent in the quality of the data or an indictment of the analyst’s skills. In most cases, the undocumented business rules are essentially trivial, in that the results of any decision has a small impact on the final result and any of the decisions made by the analysts are equally&amp;nbsp;defensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This major problem of lax or non-existent documentation is one of the main reasons I feel that analysts, and in particular analysts working in the public sector, should extensively use tools for code sharing and version control like &lt;a href="http://www.github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, use free tools whenever possible, and generally adhere to best practices in reproducible&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to put as much of my code on Github as I can these days. Much of what I write is still very disorganized and, frankly, embarrassing. A lot of what is in my Github repositories is old, abandoned code written as I was learning my craft. A lot of it is written to work with very specific, private data. Most of it is poorly documented because I am the only one who has ever had to use it, I don&amp;#8217;t interact with anyone through practices like code reviews, and frankly I am lazy when pressed with a deadline. But that&amp;#8217;s not really the point, is it? The worst documented code is code that is hidden away on a personal hard drive, written for an expensive proprietary environment most people and organizations cannot use, or worse, is not code at all but rather a series of destructive data edits and manipulations. &lt;sup id="fnref:fuckexcel"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fuckexcel" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way that I have been trying to improve the quality and utility of the code I write is by contributing to an open source R package, &lt;code&gt;eeptools&lt;/code&gt;. This is a package written and maintained by Jared Knowles, an employee of the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, whom I met at a &lt;a href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/sdp/"&gt;Strategic Data Project&lt;/a&gt; convening. &lt;code&gt;eeptools&lt;/code&gt; is consolidating several functions in R for common tasks education data analysts are faced with. Because this package is available on &lt;a href="http://cran.us.r-project.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRAN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the primary repository for R packages, any education analyst can have access to its functions in one&amp;nbsp;line: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;install.packages&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;eeptools&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; require&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;eeptools&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Submitting code to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRAN&lt;/span&gt; package reinforces several habits. First, I get to practice writing R documentation,  explaining how to use a function, and therefore, articulating the assumptions and business rules I am applying. Second, I have to write my code with a wider tolerance for input data. One of the easy pitfalls of a beginning analyst is writing code that is too specific to the dataset in front of you. Most of the errors I have found in analyses during quality control stem from assumptions embedded in code that were perfectly reasonable with a single data set that lead to serious errors when using different data. One way to avoid this issue is through &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"&gt;test-driven development&lt;/a&gt;, writing a good testing suite that tests a wide range of unexpected inputs. I am not quite there yet, personally, but thinking about how my code would have to work with arbitrary inputs and ensuring it fails gracefully &lt;sup id="fnref:fallingwithstyle"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fallingwithstyle" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is an excellent side benefit of preparing a pull request &lt;sup id="fnref:gitterms"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gitterms" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; . Third, it is an opportunity to write code for someone other than myself. Because I am often the sole analyst with my skillset working on a project, it is easy to not consider things like style, optimizations, clarity, etc. This can lead to large build-ups of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt"&gt;technical debt&lt;/a&gt;, complacency toward learning new techniques, and general sloppiness. Submitting a pull request feels like publishing. The world has to read this, so it better be something I am proud of that can stand up to the scrutiny of third-party&amp;nbsp;users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first pull request, which was accepted into the package, calculates age in years, months, or days at an arbitrary date based on date of birth. While even a beginning R programmer can develop a similar function, it is the perfect example of an easily compartmentalized component, with a broad set of applications, that can be accessed frequently&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I submitted by second pull request that I hope will be accepted. This time I covered a much more complex task&amp;#8212; calculating student mobility. To be honest, I am completely unaware of existing business rules and algorithms used to produce the mobility numbers that are federally reported. I wrote this function from scratch thinking through how I would calculate the number of schools attended by a student in a given year. I am really proud of both the business rules I have developed and the code I wrote to apply those rules. My custom function can accept fairly arbitrary inputs, fails gracefully when it finds data it does not expect, and is pretty fast. The original version of my code took close to 10 minutes to run on ~30,000 rows of data. I have reduced that with a complete rewrite prior to submission to 16&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am not sure if this request will be accepted, I will be thrilled if it is. Mobility is a tremendously important statistic in education research and a standard, reproducible way to calculate it would be a great help to researchers. How great would it be if &lt;code&gt;eeptools&lt;/code&gt; becomes one of the first packages education data analysts load and my mobility calculations are used broadly by researchers and analysts? But even if it’s not accepted because it falls out of scope, the process of developing the business rules, writing an initial implementation of those rules, and then refining that code to be far simpler, faster, and less error prone was incredibly&amp;nbsp;rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next post will probably be a review of that process and some parts of my &lt;code&gt;moves_calc&lt;/code&gt; function that I&amp;#8217;m particularly proud&amp;nbsp;of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:fuckexcel"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a spreadsheet program, such as Excel, encourages directly manipulating and editing the source data. Each change permanently changes the data. Even if you keep an original version of the data, there is no recording of exactly what was done to change the data to produce your results. Reproducibility is all but impossible of any significant analysis done using spreadsheet software.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:fuckexcel" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Wong, another graduate student and myself were part of a three-person team consulting the Rhode Island Department of Education (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIDE&lt;/span&gt;) on how to establish a new state funding formula. We worked with finance and legal staff at the department to develop the legislation for the 2010 session that would establish a state funding formula for the first time in 15 years.
 
The Board of Regents had already passed a resolution with its policy priorities that they wanted enshrined in the formula. Additionally, there had been many attempts over the past 5-10 years to pass a new formula that failed for various reasons, chief among them that all previously proposed formulas were accompanied with a call to increase state funding for education 30-50%, with some even envisioning nearly doubling the state education funding. Our task was to research funding formulas, both in practice in other states and in the literature research on school finance, and achieve the goals of the Board of Regents without proposing a mammoth increase in state aid that would sink the entire endeavor &lt;sup id="fnref:increase"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:increase" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The general sense was that while more state aid had the potential to improve the progressiveness of education expenditures, the reality is the overall spending level in Rhode Island is high, and introducing new money was less important than redistributing state aid. I share this belief, particularly because I think adding money to the right places is simple once there is already a way to equitably distribute those funds. Tying up the increase in funding alongside a distribution method is a recipe for political horse-trading that can result in all kinds of distortions that prevent aid from flowing where&amp;nbsp;needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My role in this process was primarily to create Excel simulators that would allow us to immediately track the impacts of changing different parts of the formula. I also helped &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIDE&lt;/span&gt; staff interpret the meaning of changes to the math behind the funding formula and understand what levers existed to change the formula and how these changes impacted both the resulting distribution and&amp;nbsp;policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had three&amp;nbsp;months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of people who are unhappy about the results of the formula that ultimately passed in June 2010. Because we are redistributing essentially the same amount of state aid, there are some districts that are losing money while others are gaining funds &lt;sup id="fnref:holdharmless"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:holdharmless" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Some dislike the fact that we used only a &amp;#8220;weight&amp;#8221; for free and reduced price lunch status. Alternative formulas (and formulas in other states) typically include numerous weights, from limited English proficiency and special education status, to gifted and talented and career and technical education &lt;sup id="fnref:ajello"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ajello" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And yet others were displeased that many costs, including transportation and facilities maintenance, were excluded from the state-base of education aid. Then there are those who think the transition is all off&amp;#8212; five years is too long to wait to get the increases the formula proposes, and ten years is far too fast to lose the money the formula proposes. &lt;sup id="fnref:transitions"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:transitions" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Good State Aid&amp;nbsp;System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I am proud of the formula produced for several reasons. 
First, it passed successfully and has been fully funded (and sometimes more than fully funded) each year of implementation throughout a period of massive structural budget deficits. This is no small accomplishment. The advocacy community rightfully pushes us to build ideal systems, but in our role of policy entrepreneurs we are faced with the reality that a policy that does not become law and is not supported as law may as well not exist. Producing a formula that has some of the other positive qualities discussed below, passing that formula, and implementing the formula with little fanfare is not a small&amp;nbsp;accomplishment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the formula is highly progressive, sending as much as 20 times more aid to some of our poorest communities in Rhode Island compared to the wealthiest. I am not positive how this compares to other states&amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s a topic I certainly want to work on for a future post&amp;#8212; but with just 39 cities and towns, it seems to show a high preference for &lt;em&gt;vertical equity&lt;/em&gt;, treating different cities and towns differently. There are communities on both ends of the distribution who want substantially more state funding, and our state aid formula is not sufficient to effectively crowd out local capacity for education spending and ensure that our poorest communities are spending more than our wealthier ones &lt;sup id="fnref:comparative"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:comparative" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but it&amp;#8217;s a very strong&amp;nbsp;start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the formula is relatively simple. While I do not necessarily agree that it is a virtue to have fewer weights and a simple formula in perpetuity, the experience with other states and other formula-based programs show that weights and complexities are very easy to add and very hard to take away. Once a particular policy preference is enshrined in the distribution method, it had better be right because a community of advocacy will maintain that weight long into the future. Personally, I felt it critical to start with the very simple &amp;#8220;core&amp;#8221; formula that could be adjusted over time. I have some ideas on how I might modify/add to this core that I will be sharing in this post, but I firmly believe that starting with a simple core was the right move. It is also worth noting that because of the need to ensure the transition is smoothed out so that gains in some districts equal the total losses in the others meant that even a more progressive weighting scheme would not impact school funding until the far back end of the transition period (which we proposed as 7 years but was pushed to 5 years during the legislative process), since communities were already gaining funds as fast as we could move them. For this reason, not only was a simple core preferable from my technocratic perspective, but it also was not likely to have any immediate&amp;nbsp;downside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, we removed the long-term regionalization bonuses. Rhode Island had sought to reduce the ridiculous number of school districts by providing a bonus for regionalizing in the early 90s. Unfortunately, because of the timing of the abandonment of the previous state aid formula, the districts that did choose to regionalize had their base funding locked in at a level 6-8% higher than it should have been, because they were receiving a bonus that was meant to fade away over the course of several years. I could justify a small increase in state funding to pay some of the transition expenses of regionalizing districts, but long term funding increases? Part of the goal of regionalization is the reduction of overhead that allows for decreased costs (or increased services at the same costs). There is no ongoing need to supply a massive state bonus for&amp;nbsp;regionalizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now just because I am proud of this work does not mean that I think we have &amp;#8220;solved&amp;#8221; education funding in Rhode Island. Personally, I believe there are other defensible ways to distribute funding in Rhode Island, each of which represents slightly different policy preferences. There is no hard and fast &amp;#8220;right&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;wrong&amp;#8221; way to do this, within certain guidelines. As I see it, so long as the formula is progressive and moving toward a greater chance of seeing a day where Providence has the highest paid staff in the state &lt;sup id="fnref:comparative"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:comparative" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, we are on the right path. I don&amp;#8217;t believe that Rhode Island will have a truly &amp;#8220;great&amp;#8221; education finance climate without a substantial growth in the economy or a huge new tax that dramatically lowers the ability of municipalities to generate school funding while bolstering state aid. However, I think we have a great foundation and a &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the remainder of this post, I would like to propose a few ideas that could help move Rhode Island from &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;very good&amp;#8221; that I think are feasible within the next five years &lt;sup id="fnref:goodtogreat"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:goodtogreat" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Very Good State Aid&amp;nbsp;Program&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little over three years since its establishment, I think we are ready to tackle several additional aspects of state education funding in Rhode Island. One thing you may notice is that few of these ideas impact the original formula. Part of why that is comes from my aforementioned preference for a simple formula, and part is because these include some non-formula issues that were not pursued in 2010 in an effort to keep the focus on the main policy matters. 
First, and perhaps the most consequential change that can be made to state funding, is the teacher pension fund payments. Currently, the state and local districts split the cost of teacher pension contributions 60/40. This is a flat split, regardless of the wealth of the community. I think it&amp;#8217;s absurd to ignore community wealth for such a large portion of state education expenditures. Using the Adjusted Equalized Weighted Assessment Values (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AEWAV&lt;/span&gt;) to determine the reimbursement rates would be a big improvement on the progressiveness of school&amp;nbsp;funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I would make a slight change to the way that we fund charter schools. When we were developing the formula, there was broad agreement among policymakers that the &amp;#8220;money should follow the child&amp;#8221;. In one sense, this is the system we proposed since school district funding is based on enrollments. However, I think an irrational desire to not &amp;#8220;double count&amp;#8221; students, alongside the need to keep funding as flat as possible, pushed the formula a bit too far when it comes to charters. The old way of funding charter schools allowed districts to hold back 5% of the total per pupil expenditure from their charter school tuitions. This meant charter schools received 5% less funding than traditional public schools, but it also recognized that there are some fixed costs in districts that are not immediately recoverable when students leave on the margins. I think the state should return to this practice, however only if the state is willing to pay the withheld 5% to charters. I do think its fair to take into account some fixed costs, but I don&amp;#8217;t believe it&amp;#8217;s fair that charter schools received less funding as a&amp;nbsp;result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we excluded all building maintenance costs from the base amount of state aid. This was largely because the formula was supposed to represent only the marginal instructional costs associated with each student. I don&amp;#8217;t necessarily think that these costs have to be added into the base amount. However, I would like to see the state contribute to the maintenance of buildings more directly. I think the state should provide a flat dollar amount, say &amp;#36;100,000, per building in each district, provided that key criteria are met. The buildings should be at 90% occupancy/utilization, should have a minimum size set based on the research on efficiency (roughly 300 students at the elementary level and 600 students for high schools), and there should be some minimum standard for building systems quality and upkeep. These requirements are mostly about making sure this flat fund, which is really about the fixed costs of maintaining buildings, doesn&amp;#8217;t create incentives to build more. It may seem inconsequential, but I think it&amp;#8217;s important to state the preference for well-sized, occupied &lt;sup id="fnref:occupied"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:occupied" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and maintained buildings is&amp;nbsp;worthwhile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s wrong that the minimum reimbursement rate for school construction aid was raised to 40% during the funding formula debates in the General Assembly. This amounts to a massive subsidy for suburban schools and the previous 30% minimum is part of why we have such stark facilities inequities in the state. We should remove the minimums on construction reimbursement and simply use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AEWAV&lt;/span&gt; to determine the reimbursement rate. Also, we need to establish a revolving facilities loan fund, much like the one used for sewers (and now &lt;a href="http://blogs.wpri.com/2013/03/21/ricwfa-explainer/"&gt;roads and bridges&lt;/a&gt;). Access to lower interest bonds should not be dependent on city&amp;nbsp;finances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, one thing we did not include in the original funding formula that has come under considerably criticism is a special weight for students who are labeled English language learners. There are a few reasons we made this decision. The districts that have ELLs are the same districts that have high levels of poverty. In fact, the five communities that had more than 5% of their students classified as ELLs were, in order, also the top five districts with regards to free and reduced price lunch eligibility. Combined with a transition plan that was already increasing funding to these districts as rapidly as could be afforded, there were virtually no short-term consequences of not including an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELL&lt;/span&gt; weight. It&amp;#8217;s worth noting that formula dollars are not categorical funds&amp;#8212; there are no restrictions on how districts should spend this money, and there are no guarantees that an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELL&lt;/span&gt; weight would have any impact on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also concerned with incentivizing over-identification and failing to exit students who should no longer be classified as ELLs. I am also personally concerned with mistaking the additional supports we want to target as needed for English language acquisition; it would not only inspire the wrong policies and supports for these students, but it fails to recognize a host of needs that persist for these students well beyond English&amp;nbsp;acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the funding formula hearings at House and Senate Finance Committees we discussed the need for further study on this issue. I think that the next weight in the formula should be based on the Census and American Communities Survey. By using these data sets, classification of students who are eligible for the weight would not be dependent on the school district itself. Rather than focus on child language acquisition, I think we should broaden this weight to be applied based on the percentage of households that speak a language other than English in the home, where English is spoken at a level below &amp;#8220;very well&amp;#8221; &lt;sup id="fnref:technical"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:technical" rel="footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This would ensure that students who live in language minority households receive additional supports throughout their education, regardless of their language acquisition status. I would make this weight lower than some in the literature because it would apply to a broader set of students, probably somewhere around 40% like the poverty weight. For reference, the latest five-year estimate from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACS&lt;/span&gt; data shows that 24.3% of households fit this definition in the city of Providence. With a 40% weight, at 22,500 students, with a foundation amount of around \$9,000 per student, this weight would increase funding to Providence by a little over \$16,000,000. Similar to other formula aid, these funds would be&amp;nbsp;unrestricted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, while I think that \$16,000,000 is no small potatoes, and I am happy to express our policy preference to drive funding into communities where families are not using English in the home, some perspective is warranted. Providence will receive almost \$240,000,000 in state aid when the formula is fully transitioned, compared to about \$190,000,000 before. Adding this weight would only represent a 6% increase in state aid from the full formula amount. It&amp;#8217;s an important increase, but I hope you&amp;#8217;ll forgive me if I felt it was not grossly unfair to exclude it in the first iteration of the funding formula, especially considering we still have not fully transitioned to those higher dollar amounts sent to districts that would benefit from these&amp;nbsp;funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It Takes&amp;nbsp;Money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these recommendations, in my view, would improve the way that Rhode Island distributes education aid. Some of the changes are technical, others address areas that are currently not considered, and some are purely about increasing the progressiveness of aid. All of these changes will require an even greater state contribution to education aid, but these increases would be an order of magnitude lower than what it would take to increase the state aid to covering 50-60% of all education expenditures. While I would support some pretty radical changes to drive more money into the state aid system, I think that each of these improvements are worth doing on the path to increased&amp;nbsp;aid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:increase"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note, that few people I spoke to were not in favor of raising the amount of state aid. We all want more money to come from the state because those dollars are far more progressive. However, Rhode Island was deep in its recession at this point in time and the dollar amounts to make a real dent in the state to local share in education are just staggering. Rhode Island currently funds just short of 40% of total school expenditures at the state level. To increase that to 60%, which is closer to the national average, they would have to contribute &amp;#36;500M more&amp;#8212; a roughly 60% increase from the current level. Just for some context, the main tax fight of Rhode Island progressives has been to repeal tax cuts for higher income individuals that were instituted starting in 2006 in an attempt to move toward a flat income tax rate in Rhode Island. The impact of this repeal would be an increase in revenues that would cover roughly 10% of the increase in school funding required to move from 40% to 60% state aid. Of course, those dollars are supposed to pay for some portion of restoring pension benefits, so it&amp;#8217;s already spoken for.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:increase" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:holdharmless"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold harmless provisions, when introduced in other states, serve to dramatically distort the redistributive properties of state aid and almost always require a huge influx of funds. In fact, a hold harmless provision in Rhode Island would have required a doubling of state aid, which ultimately would have guaranteed that wealthy communities continue to receive too much state aid while less wealthy communities are stuck fighting year after year for tremendous revenue increases through taxation just to get their fair share. Essentially, hold harmless would ensure that you never reach formula-level spending and guarantee that state aid would not be very progressive.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:holdharmless" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:ajello"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One very popular progressive member of the Rhode Island General Assembly had been working for years to pass a new funding formula and had five or six such weights in her version. Interestingly, with the glaring exception of sending &amp;#36;0 to Newport in state aid, the difference in the overall distribution of funds by district in Rhode Island using this formula and our formula was tiny, almost always &amp;lt;5%.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ajello" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:transitions"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoothing the &amp;#8220;gains&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;losses&amp;#8221; overtime was important to keep the formula as close to revenue neutral as possible. Of course, there are increases due to inflation and other factors each year as a part of the base, but our goal was to truly redistribute the funds such that not only is the end number not a big increase in total state aid but that getting through the transition period did not have huge costs. If it did, there is no way we could feel confident we would ever reach the point where the formula actually dictated state aid, much like the hold harmless provision prevents a full transition. Modeling various transition plans was a nightmare for me.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:transitions" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:comparative"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people forget that education spending is about competition within a single market. Overall spending matters less within this market than how you spend compared to others. The trick is that an urban school primarily working with traditionally under served families needs to be able to pay not just for more material supplies, but mostly for higher quality teachers and staff (and perhaps quantity). Because of compensating wage differentials, even hiring teachers and staff that are the same quality as wealthy communities costs more.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:comparative" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:goodtogreat"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I will write a future post on some ideas of how to push Rhode Island to &amp;#8220;great&amp;#8221;, even though I view all of those solutions as politically impossible.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:goodtogreat" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:occupied"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would include any leased space as occupied. We should encourage full utilization of the buildings, whether that includes charter schools, central office use, city government, or private companies. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:occupied" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:technical"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition is clunky, but its how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACS&lt;/span&gt; and Census track these things. This definition is clunky, but its how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACS&lt;/span&gt; and Census track these things. We could verify the data using the data reported by districts about language spoken in the home. I would recommend using this data point to assist with whether or not to include these weights for charter schools. For example, approximately half of those families that do not speak English in the home also speak English very poorly. Therefore, I might apply half of the weight to each individual child whose family reports speaking a language other than English at home. Of course, the actual proportion of the weight should be specific to the ratio of speakers of language other than English to non-very well speakers of English by community.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:technical" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I decided to repost it with a new date after recovering it from a cached version on the&amp;nbsp;web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhode Island &lt;a href="http://blogs.wpri.com/2011/11/17/analysis-why-rhode-island-passed-pension-reform-in-2011/"&gt;passed sweeping pension reform last fall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.wpri.com/2011/11/21/union-email-blasts-dems-on-pension-law-previews-legal-fight/"&gt;angering&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://blogs.wpri.com/2012/02/07/unions-to-ri-negotiate-a-pension-deal-before-you-lose-in-court/"&gt;major labor unions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rifuture.org/tag/pension"&gt;progressives&lt;/a&gt; throughout the state. These reforms have &lt;a href="http://blogs.wpri.com/2011/10/24/moodys-raimondo-chafee-pension-bill-good-for-rhode-island/"&gt;significantly decreased both the short and long-run costs to the state&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="http://blogs.wpri.com/2011/11/17/ri-lawmakers-ok-historic-pension-overhaul-by-wide-margins/"&gt;decreasing the benefits of both current and future retirees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="http://blogs.wpri.com/2011/09/16/raimondo-chafee-set-to-freeze-colas-put-all-in-hybrid-plan/"&gt;most controversial measures&lt;/a&gt; in the pension reform package was suspending annual raises &lt;sup id="fnref:raises"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:raises" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for current retirees. I have noticed two main critiques of this element. The first criticism was that ending this practice constitutes a decrease in benefits to existing retirees who did not consent to these changes, constituting a breach of contract and assault on property rights. This critique is outside of the scope of this post. What I would like to address is the second criticism, that annual raises are critical to retirement security due to inflation, especially for the most vulnerable pensioners who earn near-poverty level wages from their&amp;nbsp;pensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am broadly supportive of the changes made to the pension system in Rhode Island, I also believe that it is important to recognize the differential impact suspending annual raises has on a retired statehouse janitor who currently earns \$22,000 a year from their pension and a former state department director earning \$70,000 a year from their pension. Protecting the income of those most vulnerable to inflation is a worthy goal &lt;sup id="fnref:worthy"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:worthy" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a simple recommendation that I think can have a substantial, meaningful impact on the most vulnerable retirees at substantially less cost than annual raises. This recommendation will be attractive to liberals and conservatives, as well as the “business elite” that have long called for increasing Rhode Island’s competitiveness with neighboring states. It is time that Rhode Island leaves the company of just three other states– Minnesota, Nebraska, and Vermont– that have no tax exemptions for retirement income &lt;sup id="fnref:exemptions"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:exemptions" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Rhode Island should exempt all income from pensions and social security up to 200% of the federal poverty level from state income taxes. This would go a long way to ensuring retirement security for those who are the most in need. It would also bring greater parity between our tax code and popular retirement destination states, potentially decreasing the impulse to move to New Hampshire, North Carolina, and&amp;nbsp;Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a progressive win. It’s a decrease in taxes that conservatives should like. It shouldn’t have a serious impact on revenues, especially if it goes a long way toward quelling the union and progressive rancor about the recent reforms. And it’s far from unprecedented– in fact, some form of retirement income tax exemption exists in virtually every other&amp;nbsp;state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not be proud of taking away our most vulnerable pensioners’ annual raises, even if it was necessary. Instead of ignoring the clear impact of this provision, my hope for 2013 is that we address it, while keeping an overall pretty good change to Rhode Island’s state retirement&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;

While the rest of the internet seems to be obsessed over &lt;a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2013/07/georgia_drops_out_of_parcc_tes.html"&gt;Georgia leaving the Partnership for Assessment of College and Careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:absurdity"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:absurdity" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the real concern should be over the quality of these test&amp;nbsp;items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCSSI&lt;/span&gt; also deligently point out questions that are not well aligned to the standards, this is the least of my worries. Adjusting the difficulty of items and better alignment is something that testing companies know how to do and deal with all the time. Computerized testing is the new ground and a big part of why states are, rightfully, excited about the&amp;nbsp;consortium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBAC&lt;/span&gt; items is they represent the worst of computerized assessment. Rather than demonstrating more authentic and complex tasks, they present convoluted scenarios and even more convoluted input methods. Rather than present multimedia in a way that is authentic to the tasks, we see heavy language describing how to input what amounts to multiple choice or fill-in the blank answers. What I see here is not worth the investment in time and equipment that states are being asked to make, and it is hardly a &amp;#8220;next generation&amp;#8221; set of items that will allow us to attain more accurate measures of&amp;nbsp;achievement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBAC&lt;/span&gt; looks poised to set up students to fail because of the mechanations of test taking. This is not only tragic at face value, but assures an increase in test-prep as the items are less&amp;nbsp;authentic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of concern trolling over Georgia leaving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PARCC&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.edexcellence.net/commentary/education-gadfly-daily/flypaper/2013/thats-how-the-consortia-crumble.html"&gt;Andy Smarick on Twitter and Flypaper&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t really see this as devastating, nor do I think some kind of supplication to the Tea Party could have changed this. Short of federal mandating of common tests and standards, Georgia was never going to stay aligned with a consortium that includes Massachusetts. Georgia has an incredibly inexpensive testing program, because they have built really poor assessments that are almost entirely multiple choice. They also have some of the &lt;a href="http://educationnext.org/despite-common-core-states-still-lack-common-standards/"&gt;lowest proficiency standards in the country&lt;/a&gt;. There was no way this state would move up to a testing regime that costs more than twice as much (but is around the country median) that is substantially more complex and will have a much higher standard for proficiency. Georgia is one of those states that clearly demonstrates some of the &amp;#8220;soft bigotry of low expectations&amp;#8221; by hiding behind inflated proficiency due to low standards.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:absurdity" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPI&lt;/span&gt; Issue Brief details the differences between the retirement system for state workers before and after the passage of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIRSA&lt;/span&gt; as accurately and clearly as I have ever seen. Mr. Hiltonsmith has done a notable job explaining the differences between the new system and the old&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brief, unfortunately, fails by engaging in two common fallacies to support its broader conclusions. The first is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man"&gt;straw man fallacy&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Hiltonsmith takes a limited set of the objectives of the entire &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIRSA&lt;/span&gt; legislation and says defined contribution plans do not meet those objectives. That is true, but ignores the other objectives it does accomplish which were also part of the motivation behind &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIRSA&lt;/span&gt;. The second is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning"&gt;circular reasoning&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, Mr. Hiltonsmith states that the reason for a low funding ratio is because the state did not put 100% of its paper liability into the pension fund. This is a tautology and not in dispute and should not be trumpeted as a conclusion of&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are his three main points that he believes makes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIRSA&lt;/span&gt; a bad&amp;nbsp;policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The defined contribution plan does not save the state money from its annual pension&amp;nbsp;contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The defined contribution plan is likely to earn lower returns and therefore result in lower benefits for&amp;nbsp;retirees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The defined contribution plan does not solve the low funding ratio of the pension plan which exists because law makers did not make required&amp;nbsp;contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the defined contribution portion of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIRSA&lt;/span&gt; was not in place to do any of these three things. The purpose of including a defined contribution plan in the new state pension system is to create stability in annual budget allocations and avoid locking the government into promises it has demonstrated it fails to keep. Defined benefit plans require the state to change pension contributions when there are market fluctuations and leads to anti-cyclical costs, where the state is forced to put substantially more resources into pensions when revenues are lowest and spending on social welfare is most important. The defined contribution plan keeps the payments required by the state consistent and highly predictable. This is far preferable from a budget&amp;nbsp;perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unfortunate that there are lower returns to defined contribution plans which may lead to a decrease in overall benefits. It is my opinion that the unions in Rhode Island should be pushing for a substantially better match on the defined contribution portion of their plan that more closely resembles private sector match rates. This could more than alleviate the difference in benefits while maintaining the predictability, for budgeting purposes, of the defined contribution plan. I doubt this policy would have much hope of passing while Rhode Island slowly crawls out of a deep recession, but it is certainly a reasonable matter for future&amp;nbsp;legislatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only two ways to decrease the current pension fund shortfalls: increase payments to the fund or decrease benefits. There is no structural magic sauce to get around this. Structural changes in the pension system are aimed at reducing the likelihood that the state will reproduce its current situation, with liabilities well outstripping funds. It is true that the &amp;#8220;savings&amp;#8221; largely came from cutting benefits. I have not heard anyone claim otherwise. The only alternative was to put a big lump sum into the pension fund. That clearly was not a part of&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIRSA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is absurd to judge &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIRSA&lt;/span&gt; on the ability of defined contribution plans to achieve policy objectives that are unrelated to the purpose of this structural&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most troubling conclusion of this brief was&amp;nbsp;that, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortfall in Rhode Island’s pension plan for public employees is largely due not to overly generous benefits, but to the failure of state and local government employers to pay their required share of pensions’&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read that and expected to see evidence of skipped payments or a discussion of overly ambitious expectations for investment returns, etc. Instead, it seems that this conclusion is based simply on the fact that the benefits in Rhode Island were not deemed outrageously large, and therefore Rhode Island should just pay the liability hole. The &amp;#8220;failure&amp;#8221; here is predicated entirely on the idea that the pensions as offered should be met, period, whatever the cost to the government. This is the &amp;#8220;required share&amp;#8221;. Which, of course, is technically true without a change in the law, but feels disingenuous. It is essentially a wholesale agreement with the union interpretation of the state pension system as an immutable contract. The courts will likely resolve whether or not this is true. My objection is that Mr. Hiltonsmith makes a definitive statement on this rationale without describing it. In such a lucid description of how the retirement system has changed, it seems this could only be intentional omission intended to support a predetermined conclusion rather than illuminate the&amp;nbsp;unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Hiltonsmith also claims that, &amp;#8220;Over the long term, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIRSA&lt;/span&gt; may cost the state upwards of \$15 million a year in additional contributions while providing a smaller benefit for the average full-career worker.&amp;#8221; I am not 100% certain, but based on his use of the normal cost &lt;sup id="fnref:normal cost"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:normal cost" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to do these calculations, it appears this conclusion is drawn only based on the marginal contributions to current employees. In other words, if we &lt;em&gt;completely ignore&lt;/em&gt; the existing liability, the new plan cost the state more money marginally while potentially decreasing benefits for employees. It is my opinion that Mr. Hiltonsmith is intentionally creating the perception that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIRSA&lt;/span&gt; costs more than the current plan while providing fewer benefits. Again, this is true for future liabilities, but ignores that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIRSA&lt;/span&gt; also dramatically decreased the unfunded liabilities through cutting existing retiree benefits. So the overall cost for the act is far less, while the marginal cost was increased with the objective of decreasing the instability in government&amp;nbsp;appropriations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can have a serious debate about whether there is value in the state goals of a defined contribution plan. In my view, the purpose of switching to this structure is&amp;nbsp;about: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portability of plans for more mobile workers, potentially serving to attract younger and more highly skilled&amp;nbsp;employees. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stability in government expenditures on retiree benefits from year to year that are less susceptible to market forces. This includes avoiding the temptation to reduce payments when there are strong market returns as well as the crushing difficulty of increasing payments when the market (and almost certainly government receipts) are&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insulating workers from a government that perpetually writes checks they can cash, as was the case with the current&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper does not address any of these objectives or others I might have forgotten. In essence, the brief looks at only one subset of the perceived costs of this structural change, but it is far from a comprehensive analysis of the potential universe of both costs and benefits. In fact, it fails to even address the most commonly cited benefits. That is why I view it as heavily biased and flawed, even if I might draw similar conclusions from a more thorough&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;result&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A few notes on proper usage and the choices I made in writing this&amp;nbsp;function: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The parameters &lt;code&gt;dob&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;enddate&lt;/code&gt; expect data that is already in one of the various classes that minimally inherits the base class &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This function takes advantage of the way that R treats vectors, so both &lt;code&gt;dob&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;enddate&lt;/code&gt; can be a single or multi-element vector. For example &lt;code&gt;enddate&lt;/code&gt; is a single date, as is the default, then the function will return a vector that calculates the difference between &lt;code&gt;dob&lt;/code&gt; and that single date for each element in &lt;code&gt;dob&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;dob&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;enddate&lt;/code&gt; are both vectors with n&amp;gt;1, then the returned vector will contain the &lt;a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/r.old.html#elementwise"&gt;element-wise&lt;/a&gt; difference between &lt;code&gt;dob&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;enddate&lt;/code&gt;. When the vectors are of different sizes, the shorter vector will be repeated over until it reaches the same length as the longer vector. This is known as &lt;a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#The-recycling-rule"&gt;recycling&lt;/a&gt;, and it is the default behavior in&amp;nbsp;R.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This function always returns an integer. Calculating age in years will never return, say, 26.2. Instead, it assumes that the correct behavior for age calculations is something like a &lt;code&gt;floor&lt;/code&gt; function. For examle, the function will only return 27 if &lt;code&gt;enddate&lt;/code&gt; is minimally your 27th birthday. Up until that day you are considered 26. The same is true for age in&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the first custom function in almost 3 years using R that I wrote to be truly generalizable. I was inspired by three factors. First, this is a truly frequent task that I will have to apply to many data sets in the future that I don&amp;#8217;t want to have to revisit. Second, a professional acquaintance, &lt;a href="http://jaredknowles.com/"&gt;Jared Knowles&lt;/a&gt;, is putting together a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRAN&lt;/span&gt; package with various convenience functions for folks who are new to R and using it to analyze education data &lt;sup id="fnref:eeptools"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:eeptools" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This seemed like an appropriate addition to that package, so I wanted to write it to that standard. In fact, it was my first (and to date, only) submitted and accepted pull request on Github. Third, it is a tiny, simple function so it was easy to wrap my head around and write it well. I will let you be the judge of my success or failure &lt;sup id="fnref:inspiration"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:inspiration" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:wrote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally used &lt;code&gt;Sys.time()&lt;/code&gt; not realizing there was a &lt;code&gt;Sys.Date()&lt;/code&gt; function. Thanks to Jared Knowles for that edit in preparation for a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRAN&lt;/span&gt; check.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:wrote" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:eeptools"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/jknowles/eeptools"&gt;eeptools&lt;/a&gt; on Github.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:eeptools" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:inspiration"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="http://mcfromnz.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/updated-age-calculation-function/"&gt;Matt&amp;#8217;s Stats n Stuff&lt;/a&gt; for getting me to write this post. When I saw another age calculation function pop up on the r-bloggers feed I immediately thought of this function. Matt pointed out that it was quite hard to Google for age calculations in R, lamenting that Google doesn&amp;#8217;t meaningfully crawl Github where I linked to find my code. So this post is mostly about providing some help to less experience R folks who are frantically Googling as both Matt and I did when faced with this need.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:inspiration" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Becker</name></author><id>tag:blog.jsonbecker.com,2013-06-02:2013/06/linear-thinking.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple will be revealing new details for both of its major operating systems at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWDC&lt;/span&gt; on June 10, 2013. The focus of much speculation has been how Apple will improve multi-tasking and inter-app communication in iOS7. As batteries have grown, CPUs have become increasingly powerful, and the application &lt;a href="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/2012/11/frictionless.html"&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; has matured &lt;sup id="fnref:viticci"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:viticci" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the iOS sandboxing model has felt increasingly limiting and&amp;nbsp;outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that there is a simple change that could dramatically increase the effectiveness of multitasking on iOS by re-examining how application switching&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrolling through a long list of applications, either through the basement shelf or via the four-finger gesture on an iPad, is both slow and lacking in contextual cues. In a simple case where I am working with two applications simultaneously, how do I switch between them? The list of open applications always places the current application in the first position. The previously used application sits in the second position. The first time I want to change to another application this is not so bad. I move to the &amp;#8220;right&amp;#8221; on the list to progress forward into the next application &lt;sup id="fnref:next"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:next" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble comes when I want to return to where I was just working. The most natural mental model for this switch is to move &amp;#8220;left&amp;#8221; in the list. I moved &amp;#8220;right&amp;#8221; to get here and millions of years of evolution has taught me the the &amp;#8220;undo button&amp;#8221; for moving right is to move left &lt;sup id="fnref:inform7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:inform7" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But of course, when I attempt to move &amp;#8220;left&amp;#8221;, I find no destination &lt;sup id="fnref:youcant"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:youcant" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I can pop an application from anywhere on the list, but I can only prepend new applications to the list &lt;sup id="fnref:ignorant"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ignorant" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple needs to move away from its linear thinking and enter the second&amp;nbsp;dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I could drag apps in the switcher on top of each other to make a new stack, not unlike the option on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X launch bar? Throughout this stack, position is maintained regardless of which application is in use/was last used. I can always move &lt;strong&gt;up&lt;/strong&gt; from Chrome to ByWord, and &lt;strong&gt;down&lt;/strong&gt; to Good Reader, for example, if I was writing a report. Apple might call this a Stack, mirroring the term in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSX&lt;/span&gt;, but I would prefer this to be called a &lt;em&gt;Flow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this feature is to organize a &lt;em&gt;Flow&lt;/em&gt; for a particular task that requires using multiple apps. One feature might be saving a &amp;#8220;Flow&amp;#8221;, this way each time I want to write a blog post, I tap the same home screen button and the same four apps in the same order launch in a &lt;em&gt;Flow&lt;/em&gt;, ready for easy switching using the familiar four-finger swipe gesture up and down. I no longer have to worry about the sequence I have recently accessed applications which is confusing and requires me to look at the app switcher draw or needlessly and repeatedly swipe through applications. I never have to worry about lingering too long on one application while swiping through and switching to that app, changing my position to the origin of the list and starting over&amp;nbsp;again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the calls for complex inter-app communication or having multiple apps active on the screen at the same time, it seems a simple interface change to application switching could complete change the way we multitask on&amp;nbsp;iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:viticci"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Federico Viticci has either shown us the light or gone completely mad.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:viticci" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:next"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, lets assume the right application is next in the stack. I&amp;#8217;ll get to that issue with my second change.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:next" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:inform7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;You are in a green room. &amp;gt; Go east. You are in a red room. &amp;gt; Go west. You are in a green room.&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:inform7" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:youcant"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;You can't go that way.&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:youcant" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:ignorant"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know enough about data structures yet to name what&amp;#8217;s going on here. I am tempted to think that the challenge is they have presented a list to users, with a decidedly horizontal metaphor, when they actually have created something more akin to a stack, with a decidedly vertical metaphor. But a stack isn&amp;#8217;t quite the right way to understand the app switcher. You can &amp;#8220;pop&amp;#8221; an app from any arbitrary position on the app switcher, but funny enough can only push a new app on to the top of the switcher.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ignorant" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Becker</name></author><id>tag:blog.jsonbecker.com,2013-05-30:2013/05/cleaning-urls-with-textexpander.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I really dislike about Google Reader is it replaces the links to posts in my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed. My &lt;a href="http://pinboard.in/u:jasonpbecker"&gt;Pinboard account&lt;/a&gt; is littered with links that start with &lt;code&gt;http://feedproxy.google.com&lt;/code&gt;. I am quite concerned that with the demise of &lt;a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html"&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; on July 1, 2013, these redirects will no longer&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not just Google that obscures the actually address of links on the internet. The popularity of using link shortening services, both to save characters on Twitter and to collect analytics, has proliferated the &lt;em&gt;Internet of Redirects&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse still, after I am done cutting through redirects, I often find that the ultimate link include all kinds of extraneous attributes, most especially a barrage of &lt;code&gt;utm_*&lt;/code&gt; campaign&amp;nbsp;tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I understand why all of this is happening and the importance of the services and analytics this link cruft provides. I am quite happy to click on shortened links, move through all the redirects, and let sites know just how I found them. But quite often, like when using a bookmarking service or writing a blog post, I just want the simple, plain text &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; that gets me directly to the permanent home of the&amp;nbsp;content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One part of my workflow to deal with link cruft is a TextExpander snippet I call &lt;code&gt;cleanURL&lt;/code&gt;. It triggers a simple Python script that grabs the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; in my clipboard, traces through the redirects to the final destination, then strips links of campaign tracking attributes, and ultimately pastes a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; that is much&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;cleaner&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below I have provided the script. I hope it is useful to some other folks, and I would love some recommendations for additional &amp;#8220;cleaning&amp;#8221; that could be&amp;nbsp;performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next task is expanding this script to work with &lt;a href="http://pinboard.in"&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt; so that I can clean up all my links before the end of the month when Google Reader goes belly&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/usr/bin/python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;check_output&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;check_output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;pbpaste&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Go through the redirects to get the destination &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Look for utm attributes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;r&amp;#39;[?&amp;amp;#]utm_&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Because I&amp;#39;m not smart and trigger this with&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;# already clean URLs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;cleanURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cleanURL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
