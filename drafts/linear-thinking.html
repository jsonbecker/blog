    <p class=date> 2013-05-13 </p>
    <p>Apple will be revealing new details for both of its major operating systems at WWDC in June. The focus of much speculation has been how Apple will improve multi-tasking and inter-app communication in iOS7. As batteries have grown, CPUs have become increasingly powerful, and the application <a href="../2012/11/frictionless.html">ecosystem</a> has matured <sup id="fnref:viticci"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:viticci" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, the iOS sandboxing model has felt increasingly limiting and outdated.</p>
<p>I think that there is a simple change that could dramatically increase the effectiveness of multitasking on iOS by making two simple changes to how application switching works.</p>
<p>Scrolling through a long list of applications, either through the basement shelf or via the four-finger gesture on an iPad, is both slow and lacking in contextual cues. In a simple case where I am working with two applications simultaneously, how do I switch between them? The list of open applications always places the current application in the first position. The previously used application sits in the second position. The first time I want to change to another application this is not so bad. I move to the "right" on the list to progress forward into the next application <sup id="fnref:next"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:next" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. </p>
<p>The trouble comes when I want to return to where I was just working. The most natural mental model for this switch is to move "left" in the list. I moved "right" to get here and millions of years of evolution has taught me the the "undo button" for moving right is to move left <sup id="fnref:inform7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:inform7" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. But of course, when I attempt to move "left", I find no destination <sup id="fnref:youcant"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:youcant" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. I can pop an application from anywhere on the list, but I can only prepend new applications to the list <sup id="fnref:ignorant"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ignorant" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.

Apple needs to move away from its linear thinking and enter the second dimension.</p>
<p>The release of Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) saw a shift in how Apple implements virtual desktops. Spaces was out, replaced with Mission Control.</p>

<p>I don't know enough about data structures yet to name what's going on here. I am tempted to think that the challenge is they have presented a list to users, with a decidedly horizontal metaphor, when they actually have created something more akin to a stack, with a decidedly vertical metaphor. However, the ability to pop from an arbitrary position from the stack breaks that idea. Perhaps that's why I am so frustrated/confused by how app switching works. It seems odd to recognize the limitation of only being able to pop sequentially through a stack without being bothered by the limitation of only being able to push to the top.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ignorant" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
