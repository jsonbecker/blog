            <h1 class="title"> Summer Reading</h1>
    <p class=date> 2013-07-23 </p>
    <p>This summer has been very productive for my fiction reading backlog. Here are just some of the things I have read since Memorial Day. <sup id="fnref:affiliatescum"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:affiliatescum" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<h2>The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss</h2>
<p>I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0756405890/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20">The Name of the Wind</a> on a whim while cruising through the bookstore. I was glad I did. This book tells a classic story-- a precocious young wizard learns to use his powers, building toward being the most important person in the world. The book is framed around an innkeeper and his apprentice who are more than they seem. When a man claiming to be the most famous storyteller in the land enters the inn, we learn that our innkeeper has past filled with spectacular exploits that our bard wants to record. Lucky for our reader, Kvothe, in addition to be a warrior-wizard of extraordinary talent, is a narcissist who decides to tell his whole story just this once to this most famous of all chroniclers. <sup id="fnref:narcissist"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:narcissist" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Although I have spoken to several folks who found Kvothe to be utterly unlikeable because of both his sly form of arrogance and Rothfuss's decision to seemingly make Kvothe worthy of such high self-worth, I loved this book. </p>
<p>In this first book of the <em>The Kingkiller Chronicle</em> (as these things tend to be named), we learn all about Kvothe's formative years. We spend substantial time exploring dark times in Kvothe's life when he endures tragedy, trauma, and horrible poverty before finally beginning to learn how to truly use his talents. It is a fair critique that Kvothe seems almost "too good", but much of the story is about how skill, luck, and folly all contribute to his success and fame, much of which is based on exaggerated tellings of true events.</p>
<p>If you are a fan of this sort of fantasy, with magic, destiny, love, power, and coming of age, I recommend picking up this book. Rothfuss has a gift The sequel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0756407915/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20">The Wise Man's Fear</a> is already available, and I will certainly be reading it before the end of the summer.</p>
<h2>Endymion and The Rise of Endymion by Dan Simmons</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553572946/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20">Endymion</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553572989/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20">The Rise of Endymion</a> are the must anticipated (15 years ago) follow up to Dan Simmons's brilliant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553283685/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20">Hyperion</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553288202/?tag=jasonpbeckerc-20">Fall of Hyperion</a>. I strongly recommend the originals, which is one of the greatest tales in all of science fiction. I also recommend creating some distance between reading each set of books. Six years separate the publishing of these duologies. Each story is so rich, I think it is hard to appreciate if you read all four books in one go. Yet, the narrative is so compelling it might be hard to resist. I waited about one year between reading the original <em>Cantos</em> and this follow up and I was glad I did.</p>
<p>Set 272 years after the events of the original books, <em>Endymion</em> and <em>The Rise of Endymion</em> serve as crucial stories that satisfyingly close loops I did not even realize were open at the end of the originals. What was once a glimpse at future worlds and great cosmic powers now unfurl as major players, their primary motivations unveiled. </p>
<p>These books are so entwined with the original that I will not say anything about its plot so that there are no spoilers. What I can offer is the following. Whereas books 1 and 2 play with story structure to captivating effect, these books do not. Instead, we are treated to a uniquely omniscient narrator, who is both truly omniscient and integral to the events of the story. How he gains this omniscience is a major plot point that's pulled off effortlessly. The first two books are framed as an epic poem, known as the <em>Hyperion Cantos</em>, written by one of the major characters in those events. Another thing we learn is the original <em>Cantos</em> is not entirely reliable. Their author, who as not omniscient, had to fill in some blanks to complete the story, and also failed to understand some of the "heady" aspects of what happened and was sloppy in their explanations. Thus, we are treated both to key future events and simultaneously charged with a new reading of the original novels as written by a less than reliable narrator. What is true and what is not will all be told in this excellent follow up.</p>
<p>A word to the wise-- Simmons may feel a bit "mushy" in his message for some "hard" science fiction readers. I think there is both profound depth and beautiful presentation of ideas, both complex enough to "earn" this treatment and some simpler than the story seems to warrant.</p>
